marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 30 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds . how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad 's ?,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as M and the weight of his dad's strawberries as D. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write:

M = 30

We are also given that together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds, so we can write:

M + D = 17

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights. We can subtract the weight of his dad's strawberries from Marco's strawberries:

M - D

Substituting the value of M from the first equation, we have:

30 - D

To solve for D, we can substitute the value of M from the first equation into the second equation:

30 + D = 17

Simplifying this equation, we get:

D = 17 - 30 = << 17 - 30 = -13 >> -13

Now we can substitute this value back into our expression for the difference in weights:

30 - (-13) = << 30 - (-13) = 43 >> 43

Given that Dave initially had 7 tickets and he still has 2 tickets left, we can set up the equation:

7 - x = 2

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get:

-x = 2 - 7 = << 2 - 7 = -5 >> -5

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

x = -1 * (-5) = << -1 * (-5) = 5 >> 5

after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that 317 visitors came to the buckingham palace that day . if there were 295 visitors the previous day how many more visitors visited the buckingham palace on that day than on the previous day ?,"To find out how many more visitors visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous day, we need to subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day.

Number of visitors on that day: 317
Number of visitors on the previous day: 295

To find the difference, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day:

 317 - 295 = << 317 - 295 = 22 >> 22 

Therefore, there were 22 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day than on the previous day.

mom buys 51 white t - shirts . if white t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 3 how many packages will she have ?,"To find out how many packages of white t-shirts mom will have, we need to divide the total number of white t-shirts by the number of t-shirts in each package.

Total number of white t-shirts = 51
Number of t-shirts in each package = 3

To calculate the number of packages, we can use division:

51 / 3 = << 51 / 3 = 17 >> = 17

Dividing 51 by 3 gives us:

51 / 3 = << 51 / 3 = 17 >> = 17

Therefore, mom will have 17 packages of white t-shirts.

a mailman has to give 5 pieces of junk mail to each block . if he gives 25 mails to each house in a block how many houses are there in a block ?,"To find the number of houses in a block, we can divide the total number of mails given to the block by the number of mails given to each house.

Let's denote the number of houses in a block as x.

The total number of mails given to the block is 5 pieces of junk mail per block multiplied by the number of houses in a block, which is 25 mails per house. So, we have:

 5x = 25 

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:

5x / 5 = 25 / 5 = << 25 / 5 = 5 >> = 5

Simplifying:

 x = 5 

Therefore, there are 5 houses in a block.

Lucy bought 10 packs of cookies and 4 packs of cakes.

So, the calculation would be: 10 - 4 = << 10 - 4 = 6 >> 6.

Therefore, Lucy bought 6 more packs of cookies than cakes.

Then, 4 more people got on the bus at the next stop. To find out how many people are on the bus now, we need to add the initial number of people to the number of people who got on at the next stop.

Initial number of people on the bus: 12
Number of people who got on at the next stop: 4

To find the total number of people on the bus now, we can add these two numbers together:

12 + 4 = << 12 + 4 = 16 >> 16

Therefore, there are currently 16 people on the bus.

the cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet . if they are travelling at speed of 17 how much farther until they reach the end of the cave ?,"To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we can subtract the depth they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave.

Total depth of the cave: 1218 feet
Depth already traveled: 849 feet

To find the remaining distance, we subtract the depth already traveled from the total depth of the cave:

1218 - 849 = << 1218 - 849 = 369 >> 369

Therefore, they need to travel an additional 369 feet until they reach the end of the cave.
