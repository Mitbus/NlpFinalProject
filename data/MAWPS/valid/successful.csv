marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 30 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds . how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad 's ?,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as M and the weight of his dad's strawberries as D. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write:

M = 30

We are also given that together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds, so we can write:

M + D = 17

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights. We can subtract the weight of his dad's strawberries from Marco's strawberries:

M - D

Substituting the value of M from the first equation, we have:

30 - D

To solve for D, we can substitute the value of M from the first equation into the second equation:

30 + D = 17

Simplifying this equation, we get:

D = 17 - 30 = << 17 - 30 = -13 >> -13

Now we can substitute this value back into our expression for the difference in weights:

30 - (-13) = << 30 - (-13) = 43 >> 43

Given that Dave initially had 7 tickets and he still has 2 tickets left, we can set up the equation:

7 - x = 2

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation, we get:

-x = 2 - 7 = << 2 - 7 = -5 >> -5

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

x = -1 * (-5) = << -1 * (-5) = 5 >> 5

- The grasshopper jumped 36 inches.
- The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to add the additional distance it jumped compared to the grasshopper.

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 19 inches.
The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is x - 12 inches.
We know that the grasshopper's jump distance is 39 inches.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 19 = 39.
Simplifying the equation, we have: x = 39 - 19 = << 39 - 19 = 20 >> 20.
We find: x = 20.
So, the frog jumped 20 inches.
To find the distance the mouse jumped, we substitute the value of x into the expression for the mouse's jump distance: 20 - 12 = x into the expression for the mouse's jump distance: x = 20 - 12.
Calculating, we find: 20 - 12 = << 20 - 12 = 8 >> 8
Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

It is also mentioned that her hair is now 10 inches long. So we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = 10

To find the value of x, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x - 20 + 20 = 10 + 20

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = 10 + 20 = << 10 + 20 = 30 >> 30

Therefore, Robin's hair was originally 30 inches long before she cut it.

Now, we can calculate the distance the mouse jumped:

 25 + 18 + 2 = << 25 + 18 + 2 = 45 >> 45  

So, the mouse jumped 45 inches.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the total distance the mouse jumped and then subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped. 

Let's calculate the distance each of them jumped:

- The frog jumped 19 (grasshopper's jump) + 10 (extra) = 19 + 10 = << 19 + 10 = 29 >> 29 inches.
- The mouse jumped 29 (frog's jump) + 20 (extra) = 29 + 20 = << 29 + 20 = 49 >> 49 inches.

Now, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

49 (mouse's jump) - 19 (grasshopper's jump) = << 49 - 19 = 30 >> 30

So, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 35 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much did they jump altogether ?,"It seems there might be a typo in the problem statement, as it mentions that the grasshopper jumped 35 inches and then jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper. It's not clear who the second grasshopper is supposed to be. I assume you meant to say that the frog jumped 4 inches less than the grasshopper. 

Let's calculate the total distance they jumped.

The grasshopper jumped 35 inches, and the frog jumped 4 inches less than the grasshopper.

So, the frog jumped 35 - 4 = 31 inches.

To find the total distance they jumped altogether, we can add the distances jumped by the grasshopper and the frog:

35 + 31 = << 35 + 31 = 66 >> 66

So, they jumped a total of 66 inches altogether.

#### 66"
the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?,"Let's use algebra to solve this problem step by step. We'll represent the distance the frog jumped as F (in inches).

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, which means the grasshopper's jump can be represented as F + 4.
3. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump can be represented as F - 44.

Now, we have three pieces of information:

- The grasshopper's jump (G) = 19 inches.
- The grasshopper's jump (G) = the frog's jump (F) + 4 inches.
- The mouse's jump (M) = the frog's jump (F) - 44 inches.

We can write these equations:

1. G = 19
2. G = F + 4
3. M = F - 44

We can now use these equations to solve for the frog's jump (F).

First, from equation 2, we know that G = F + 4. Since we know G = 19, we can substitute that into the equation:

19 = F + 4

Now, we can isolate F by subtracting 4 from both sides:

F = 19 - 4 = << 19 - 4 = 15 >> 15

So, the frog jumped 15 inches.

#### 15"
the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the frog jumped 39 inches and the grasshopper jumped 17 inches . how much farther did the frog jump than the grasshopper ?,"To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, you subtract the length of the grasshopper's jump from the length of the frog's jump.

So, you need to calculate: 39 - 17 = << 39 - 17 = 22 >> 22

So, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.

#### 22"
the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 14 inches . the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.
2. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 14 + 37 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse jumped (14 + 37) - 16 inches.

Now, let's calculate each of these:

1. Grasshopper's jump: 14 inches
2. Frog's jump: 14 + 37 inches
3. Mouse's jump: (14 + 37) - 16 inches

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump: ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump: ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14 = << ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14 = 21 >> 21

So, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

- Jake has 18 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 19 - 18 = << 19 - 18 = 1 >> 1 peach.

Now that we know how many peaches Jake has, we can find out how many peaches Jill has:
- Steven has 13 more peaches than Jill, and we know that Steven has 19 peaches, so Jill has 19 - 13 = << 19 - 13 = 6 >> 6 peaches.

So, Jill has 6 peaches.

jake has 7 fewer peaches than steven and 9 more peaches than jill . steven has 16 peaches . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Steven has 16 peaches.
2. Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill.

We can start by finding out how many peaches Jill has. Since Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, and we know Steven has 16 peaches, we can calculate Jill's peaches:

Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 9
Jill's peaches = 16 - 9 = << 16 - 9 = 7 >> 7 peaches

Now that we know Jill has 7 peaches, and Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, we can calculate how many peaches Jake has:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 7
Jake's peaches = 16 - 7 = << 16 - 7 = 9 >> 9 peaches

So, Jake has 9 peaches.

#### 9"
jake has 7 fewer peaches than steven and 8 more peaches than jill . steven has 17 peaches . how many peaches does jill have ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We are given that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as Steven's peaches minus 7: Jake = Steven - 7.

2. We are also given that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as Jill's peaches plus 8: Jake = Jill + 8.

3. We know that Steven has 17 peaches: Steven = 17.

Now, we can set up two equations using the information we have:

Jake = Steven - 7
Jake = Jill + 8

Since we know that Steven has 17 peaches, we can substitute 17 for Steven in the first equation:

Jake = 17 - 7 = << 17 - 7 = 10 >> 10

Now that we know Jake has 10 peaches, we can use this information to find out how many peaches Jill has. We can substitute 10 for Jake in the second equation:

10 = Jill + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides to find Jill's peaches:

Jill = 10 - 8 = << 10 - 8 = 2 >> 2

So, Jill has 2 peaches.

#### 2"
jake has 6 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 18 more peaches than jill . if jill has 5 peaches how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's break down the information provided step by step:

1. Jill has 5 peaches.
2. Steven has 18 more peaches than Jill.

To find how many peaches Steven has, we add 18 to the number of peaches Jill has:

5 + 18 = << 5 + 18 = 23 >> 23 peaches.

3. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven.

To find how many peaches Jake has, we subtract 6 from the number of peaches Steven has:

23 - 6 = << 23 - 6 = 17 >> 17 peaches.

So, Jake has 17 peaches.

#### 17"
jake has 16 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 15 more peaches than jill . if jill has 12 peaches how many more peaches does jill have than jake ?,"Let's break down the information given step by step:

1. Jill has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill.
3. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven.

Now, let's calculate how many peaches Steven and Jake have:

- Steven has 12 (Jill's peaches) + 15 (more peaches) = 12 + 15 = << 12 + 15 = 27 >> 27 peaches.
- Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, which means he has 27 - 16 = << 27 - 16 = 11 >> 11 peaches.

Now, let's calculate how many more peaches Jill has than Jake:

- Jill has 12 peaches, and Jake has 11 peaches.
- To find the difference, we subtract Jake's peaches from Jill's peaches: 12 - 11 = << 12 - 11 = 1 >> 1.

So, Jill has 1 more peach than Jake.

jake has 6 fewer peaches and 8 more apples than steven . steven has 17 peaches and 16 apples . how many more peaches than apples does steven have ?,"To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we first need to determine the number of peaches and apples Jake has. Then, we can calculate the difference between the number of peaches and apples Steven has.

Given information:
- Steven has 17 peaches.
- Steven has 16 apples.
- Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven.
- Jake has 8 more apples than Steven.

Let's calculate how many peaches Jake has:
Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 6 = 17 - 6 = << 17 - 6 = 11 >> 11

Now, let's calculate how many apples Jake has:
Jake's apples = Steven's apples + 8 = 16 + 8 = << 16 + 8 = 24 >> 24

Now, we can find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has:
Difference = Steven's peaches - Steven's apples = 17 - 16 = << 17 - 16 = 1 >> 1

So, Steven has 1 more peach than apples.

jake has 3 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than steven . steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples . how many more apples than peaches does steven have ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples.
2. Jake has 3 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than Steven.

Now, let's calculate how many peaches and apples Jake has:

- Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so he has 12 - 3 peaches.
- Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so he has 15 + 10 apples.

Now, let's find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has:

- Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples, so he has 15 - 12 apples more than peaches.

Calculating the difference:

 15 - 12 = << 15 - 12 = 3 >> 3 

So, Steven has 3 more apples than peaches.

jake has 84 more apples and 10 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's break down the information provided in the question:

1. Steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples.
2. Jake has 84 more apples than Steven.
3. Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven.

Now, we need to calculate how many apples Jake has and then use that information to determine how many peaches he has.

First, let's calculate how many apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 84 more apples than Steven, who has 52 apples. So, Jake has:

52 + 84 = << 52 + 84 = 136 >> 136 apples.

Now, we need to find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches. Therefore, Jake has:

13 - 10 = << 13 - 10 = 3 >> 3 peaches.

So, Jake has 3 peaches.

jake has 13 more apples and 17 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples . how many apples does jake have ?,"Let's break this problem down step by step.

1. Steven has 8 peaches and 12 apples.
2. Jake has 13 more apples than Steven. So, Jake has 12 + 13 apples.
3. Jake also has 17 fewer peaches than Steven. Steven has 8 peaches, so Jake has 8 - 17 peaches.

Now, let's calculate the number of apples and peaches Jake has:

Jake's apples: 12 + 13 = << 12 + 13 = 25 >> 25
Jake's peaches: 8 - 17 = << 8 - 17 = -9 >> -9

Now, we need to ensure that the number of peaches is a non-negative number because it doesn't make sense to have a negative quantity of peaches. So, let's set it to zero if it's negative.

Jake's peaches (adjusted): 0

So, Jake has 25 apples and 0 peaches.

Answer: Jake has 25 apples.

nell collects baseball cards . she had 528 cards while jeff had 11 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 252 cards left . how many cards did nell give to jeff ?,"Let's break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Nell initially had 528 cards, and Jeff had 11 cards.

Step 2: Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff, and now she has 252 cards left.

Step 3: We need to find out how many cards Nell gave to Jeff.

To solve this, we can set up an equation:

Nell's initial cards - Cards given to Jeff = Cards Nell has left
528 - X = 252

Now, we can solve for X:

 528 - X = 252 

Subtract 528 from both sides to isolate X:

 -X = 252 - 528 

 -X = << 252 - 528 = -276 >> -276 

Now, divide both sides by -1 to find X:

 X = 276 

So, Nell gave Jeff 276 cards.

1. Nell starts with 566 cards.
2. Jeff starts with 234 cards.

Nell gives some of her cards to Jeff and ends up with 535 cards left. We need to find out how many cards Jeff has now.

Let's denote the number of cards Nell gives to Jeff as x.

3. Nell gives x cards to Jeff.

After giving x cards to Jeff, Nell has 535 cards left, so we can write the equation:

566 - x = 535

Now, let's solve for x:

x = 566 - 535 = << 566 - 535 = 31 >> 31
x = 31

So, Nell gave 31 cards to Jeff.

4. Jeff had 234 cards to start with, and Nell gave him an additional 31 cards.

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we can add these two quantities:

2. Nell also had 38 sets of 10 cards. So, she had 38 * 10 = 380 10 cards.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cards Nell had initially:

Total cards = 239 baseball cards + 380 10 cards

3. Nell gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 10 cards and 111 baseball cards left.

We know that she currently has 376 10 cards and 111 baseball cards. 

4. Now, let's calculate the difference between the number of 10 cards and baseball cards she has currently:

Difference = 376 10 cards - 111 baseball cards

5. Finally, let's find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell currently has:

robin has some packages of gum . there are 7 pieces in each package . robin has 6 extra pieces of gum . in all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41 . how many packages does robin have ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each package of gum contains 7 pieces.
2. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum.

To find out how many packages Robin has, we need to determine the number of packages that account for the 6 extra pieces and the remaining pieces that make up a total of 41 pieces of gum.

Let P represent the number of packages Robin has.

So, the total number of pieces of gum can be calculated as follows:
Total pieces of gum = Number of packages * Pieces per package + Extra pieces
Total pieces of gum = 7P + 6

Now, we know that the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41, so we can set up an equation:

7P + 6 = 41

To solve for P (the number of packages Robin has), we can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:

7P =  41 - 6 = << 41 - 6 = 35 >> 35

Now, we can isolate P by dividing both sides by 7:

P = 35 / 7 = << 35 / 7 = 5 >> 5

So, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
