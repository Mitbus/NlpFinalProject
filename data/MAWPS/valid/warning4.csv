julia played tag with some kids on monday . she played tag with number0 kids on tuesday . if she played with a total of number1 kids how many kids did she play with on monday ?,"[14,16]","[-,number1,number0]",2,"[33,34,35,10,12,13,14,24,25,26]",julia played tag with some kids on monday . she played tag with number0 kids on tuesday . if she played with a total of number1 kids,how many kids did she play with on monday ?,Subtraction,[23],3,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Julia played tag with some kids on Monday, and she played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday. If she played with a total of 16 kids, we need to find out how many kids she played with on Monday.

To solve this, we can set up an equation:

$ \text{Number of kids Julia played with on Monday} + \text{Number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday} = \text{Total number of kids} $

Let's substitute the values we know:

$ \text{Number of kids on Monday} + 14 = 16 $

Now, we need to isolate the number of kids on Monday. We can do that by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:

$ \text{Number of kids on Monday} = 16 - 14 $

Now, we can calculate:

$ \text{Number of kids on Monday} = 2 $

So, Julia played with 2 kids on Monday.

Let's denote the number of hours Julia spent playing tag with 19 kids on Monday as \( x \) hours, and the number of hours she spent playing tag with 18 kids on Tuesday as \( y \) hours. We know that the total time she spent playing tag on both days is 38 hours. So, we can write the following equation:

\[ x + y = 38 \quad \text{(1)} \]

We also know that she played tag with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday. We need to find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday. Let's denote this difference as \( z \). We can write another equation based on the number of kids she played with:

\[ 19 - 18 = z \quad \text{(2)} \]

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

From equation (1), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 38 - x \]

Substituting this into equation (2), we can solve for \( z \):

\[ 19 - 18 = 38 - x \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ x = 21 \]

Now that we know the value of \( x \), we can find the value of \( y \) using equation (1):

\[ y = 38 - x = 38 - 21 = 17 \]

Finally, we can find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday (\( z \)):

\[ z = 19 - 18 = 1 \]

After eating some pieces of candy, he had 22 - x pieces of candy left.

Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 = 17 - x pieces of candy left.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

-x = -9

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)

x = 9

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

Starting with what we know:

Jerry initially had 7 action figures, and then he added some more. After that, he removed 10 of the old ones. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf after adding some and removing 10 old ones is:

Let's use algebraic reasoning with $ symbols to represent the initial number of action figures.

Jerry's initial number of action figures + 2 (added) - 7 (removed) = 10 (current total)

So, we can express this as an equation:

Now, let's solve for Initial.

$ Initial - 5 = 10 $

So, the total number of campers rowing is the sum of campers in the morning and afternoon:

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Some campers went rowing in the morning.
2. 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

According to the problem, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 60. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

M (campers in the morning) + A (campers in the afternoon) = 60

We also know that 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon:

A = 7

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation:

M + 7 = 60

Next, we want to solve for M (the number of campers who went rowing in the morning), so we need to isolate M on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

M + 7 - 7 = 60 - 7

M = 53

We need to find out how much money Edward had before he spent his money. We can set up an equation to solve for that:

Money before spending - 17 (money spent) + 10 (money received) = 7 (money he has now)

So, Money before spending - 17 + 10 = 7.

$ F = S + 8 $

Now, let's consider the total amount of flour needed according to the recipe, which is 6 cups. We can express this as:

$ F = 6 $

And the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups, which can be represented as:

$ S = 13 $

Now, we have a system of equations:

1. $ F = S + 8 $
2. $ F = 6 $
3. $ S = 13 $

We can substitute the values of F and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

$ 6 = 13 + 8 $

Now, we need to solve for the number of cups of flour needed. Subtract 13 from both sides:

$ 6 - 13 = 13 + 8 - 13 $

$ -7 = 8 - 13 $

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:

$ -7 - 8 = 8 - 13 - 8 $

$ -15 = -5 $

This equation doesn't make sense; it implies that there is no solution to the problem.

1. Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park.
2. He threw away 51 old ones.
3. After that, he had 33 bottle caps in his collection.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to determine his initial collection before he found the 63 bottle caps at the park.

Initial collection + Found at the park - Threw away = Final collection

Let's represent this with equations:

Let C represent Danny's initial collection.

C + 63 (found at the park) - 51 (threw away) = 33 (final collection)

Now, we can solve for C:

C + 63 - 51 = 33

C + 12 = 33

Subtract 12 from both sides:

C = 33 - 12

C = 21

So, Danny initially had 21 bottle caps.

2. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 sets of 10 cards left. To find the number of cards she had left initially, we can calculate:

$ (309 + 356 \times 10) - (415 - 149 \times 10) = (309 + 3560) - (415 - 1490) = 3870 - 415 + 1490$.

Let's simplify this:

$3870 - 415 + 1490 = 3455 + 1490$.

Now, let's add these two numbers:

$3455 + 1490 = 4945$.

So, Nell has 4945 more baseball cards than 10 cards.

1. Nell starts with 246 baseball cards.
2. Nell also has 214 10 cards.
3. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards left.
4. She also has 495 10 cards left.

We need to find out how many more 10 cards Nell has than baseball cards after giving some to Jeff.

First, let's calculate the initial total number of cards:

Initial total cards = Total baseball cards + Total 10 cards
Initial total cards = 246 (baseball cards) + 214 (10 cards)

Now, we know Nell gave some cards to Jeff, so we'll calculate the final total cards:

Final total cards = Total baseball cards left + Total 10 cards left
Final total cards = 404 (baseball cards left) + 495 (10 cards left)

To find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the final number of baseball cards from the final number of 10 cards:

Difference = Total 10 cards left - Total baseball cards left

Let's do the calculations:

Initial total cards = 246 + 214 = 460
Final total cards = 404 + 495 = 899

Now, find the difference:

Difference = 899 (10 cards left) - 404 (baseball cards left)

Difference = 495

So, Nell has 495 more 10 cards than baseball cards.

First, you know that they sold a total of 95 T-shirts during both games. If 47 T-shirts were sold during the Arkansas game, you can find out how many T-shirts were sold during the Texas Tech game by subtracting the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of T-shirts sold:

$95 - 47 = 48$

So, they sold 48 T-shirts during the Texas Tech game.

Next, you know that the shop makes $87 off each T-shirt sold. To find out how much money they made from selling the T-shirts during the Arkansas game, you can multiply the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game (47) by the profit made from each T-shirt ($87):

\[
\text{Number of bananas in each group} = \frac{192}{345}

Now, we find out how many oranges are in each group. We know that there are 384 oranges in total, and they are organized into 16 groups. To find out how many oranges are in each group, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of orange groups:
\[

1. Brenda's mother made a total of 22 cookies.
2. Brenda and her mother had to throw away 17 cookies.
3. They had the same number of cookies.

We need to find out how many cookies Brenda and her mother each had before they had to throw away the 17 cookies. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Let's call the number of cookies Brenda and her mother each had before they threw away 17 cookies as ""x"".

So, Brenda had x cookies, and her mother had x cookies.

Now, we know they had to throw away 17 cookies in total. This means:

Brenda threw away x cookies, and her mother threw away x cookies. So, together they threw away 2x cookies.

Now, we can set up an equation:

2x = 17

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

2x/2 = 17/2

x = 8.5

$G \times C = 10$

Now, we can solve for G:

$G = \frac{10}{C}$

Since each guest had 2 cookies:

$G = \frac{10}{2}$

Now, calculate the value of G:

$G = 5$

next on his checklist are wax to stick the feathers together . if he currently has 11 g of wax and the feathers require a total of 492 g of wax how many more grams of wax does he need ?

The question states that he currently has 11 g of wax.
The question also states that the feathers require a total of 492 g of wax.

To calculate how many more grams of wax he needs, we subtract the amount he has (11 g) from the total amount required (492 g):

$492 - 11 = 481$

Therefore, he needs $481$ more grams of wax."

According to the question, 294 pickers fill 244 drums of grapes per day.
So each picker fills 244/294 = $0.829$ drums of grapes per day.  

The question also states that 47 drums of raspberries are filled per day. 
This information is not relevant to calculating the number of drums of grapes filled.

The number of days given is 146 days.

To calculate the total drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we multiply:

$0.829$ drums of grapes per picker per day  
* 294 pickers
* 146 days

$0.829 * 294 * 146 = $37,046$ drums of grapes

####$37,046$####

So in 146 days, $37,046$ drums of grapes will be filled."

The problem statement says:

he was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day.

So each picker can fill $8$ drums of grapes per day.

There are $36$ pickers.

So together they can fill $8 * 36 = 288$ drums of grapes per day.

The question asks: how many days will it take to fill $240$ drums of grapes?

We need to find the number of days it will take $36$ pickers filling $288$ drums of grapes per day to fill $240$ drums of grapes.

We can set up a proportion:

$240$ drums of grapes / $x$ days of work  = $288$ drums of grapes / $1$ day of work

Solving for $x$:

$x$ = $240$ drums of grapes / ($288$ drums of grapes / $1$ day of work)

$x$ = $240$ / $288$ 

$x$ = $0.8333...$ days

So it will take $0.83$ days or approximately $8$ hours for $36$ pickers filling $288$ drums of grapes per day to fill $240$ drums of grapes.

First, we'll calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks:
- John will use 12 large planks.
- Each large plank needs 14 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is $12 \times 14$.

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks:
- John will use 17 small planks.
- Each small plank needs 25 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is $17 \times 25$.

Now, we can add the number of nails needed for both the large and small planks to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = ($12 \times 14$) + ($17 \times 25$)

Now, let's calculate this expression:

Total nails needed = $168 + 425$

Now, we can add these two values together to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = $168 + 425 = 593$

So, John needs 593 nails for the house wall. Now, to find the total number of planks, we can divide this number by the number of nails needed for each plank, which is 14 for large planks and 25 for small planks:

Total planks needed = $\dfrac{593}{14 + 25}$
Total planks needed = $\dfrac{593}{39}$

Now, let's calculate this division:

Total planks needed ≈ 15.2051 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

So, John needs approximately 15.2051 planks for the house wall. Since you can't have a fraction of a plank, he will need 16 planks for the house wall.

Robin also has 45 packages of candy, each containing 9 pieces, so he has \( 45 \times 9 \) pieces of candy.

To find the total number of pieces of candy Robin has, add the pieces of gum and pieces of candy together:

\( 21 \times 9 + 45 \times 9 = (21 + 45) \times 9 = 66 \times 9 \).

Calculating \( 66 \times 9 \), we get \( 594 \).

To find the total number of pieces Robin has, we can first find the total number of pieces in the gum packages and then add the total number of pieces in the candy packages.

Number of pieces in gum packages: \( 28 \times 6 = 168 \)
Number of pieces in candy packages: \( 14 \times 6 = 84 \)

Total number of pieces Robin has: \( 168 + 84 = 252 \)

Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake, so the total cost of her groceries can be expressed as $2c + 12k$. 

The amount of change she had remaining is $56$, so we can set up the equation:

\[2c + 12k + 56 = 0\]

Now, let's express the cost of the groceries in terms of the change:

\[2c + 12k = 56\]

We need to find the total number of packs of groceries, which is \(2 + 12\). Now, we can substitute \(2c + 12k\) with \(56\) in this expression:

\[2 + 12 = 14\]

Adam can fit 10 action figures on each shelf, and his room can hold 8 action figures. To find out how many shelves are needed to hold the 8 action figures, we can divide the total number of action figures by the number that can fit on each shelf.

So, the calculation is:
