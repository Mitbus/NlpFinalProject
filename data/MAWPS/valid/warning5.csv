1. We are given that there are 3 red peaches in the basket.

2. It's also mentioned that there are 10 more green peaches than red peaches. This means the number of green peaches is 10 more than the number of red peaches.

3. So, we can express the number of green peaches as: $ \text{Number of Green Peaches} = \text{Number of Red Peaches} + 10 $

4. We already know that there are 3 red peaches, so to find the number of green peaches, we just need to add 10 to this number.

5. $ 3 + 10 = 13 $ green peaches.

So, there are 13 green peaches in the basket.

Now, let's calculate how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did:

1. Zachary did 17 crunches.
2. Zachary did 5 push-ups.
3. To find how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 17 (crunches) - 5 (push-ups) = 12 more crunches than push-ups.

Danny found $11$ bottle caps and $28$ wrappers at the park.
He now has $68$ bottle caps and $51$ wrappers in his collection.
So before finding these at the park, he had $68-11= 57$ bottle caps and $51-28 = 23$ wrappers.  

Therefore, at the park he found:
$11$ bottle caps 
$28$ wrappers

Now to calculate how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found at the park:
$28$ wrappers - $11$ bottle caps = $17$ more wrappers

1. Initially, Danny had 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps.
2. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers.
3. Let's calculate how many wrappers and bottle caps he started with.

To find the initial number of bottle caps, we can subtract the current number of bottle caps from the number of bottle caps he started with:

Initial bottle caps = 29 (initial) - 42 (current) = 29 - 42 = -13

Now, let's find the initial number of wrappers by subtracting the current number of wrappers from the number of wrappers he started with:

Initial wrappers = 82 (initial) - 61 (current) = 82 - 61 = 21

So, Danny initially had -13 bottle caps and 21 wrappers. However, a negative number of bottle caps doesn't make sense in this context. It's likely there was an error in the problem statement or data provided.

Dave started with 21 apps on his phone, added 89 new apps, and then deleted ""x"" apps. This means that after deleting ""x"" apps, he had 24 apps left.

So, the equation representing this situation would be: 21 + 89 - x = 24.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve the equation:

110 - x = 24.

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

110 - 24 - x = 24 - 24.

This simplifies to:

86 - x = 0.

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 86 from both sides of the equation:

86 - x - 86 = 0 - 86.

This simplifies to:

-x = -86.

To solve for ""x"", we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps.

Number of oranges in each sack = 25
Number of days of harvest = 87

Total number of oranges = Number of sacks per day × Number of oranges per sack × Number of days of harvest

Total number of oranges = $66 \times 25 \times 87$

Now, we can calculate the total earnings for one week (regular pay + overtime pay):

$28 + $939 = $967 per week

Since Lewis works 1091 weeks during the harvest season, we can find his total earnings by multiplying the weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

Given the information provided:

Earnings per week = $403

Total number of crackers and cakes = 13 (crackers) + 15 (cakes) = 28

Now, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate.

Number of crackers and cakes each person ate = Total number of crackers and cakes / Number of friends = 28 / 28 = 1

Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.

We can find out how many eggs Rebecca has by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group.

Let's represent the total number of eggs as ""E"" and the number of eggs in each group as ""G.""

$ E $ divided by $ G $ will give us the number of groups, and then we can multiply that by the number of eggs in each group to find the total number of eggs.

So, the calculation is:
$ E \div G = \text{Number of groups} $
$ \text{Number of groups} \times G = \text{Total number of eggs} $

In this case:
$ E \div 11 = \text{Number of groups} $
$ \text{Number of groups} \times 2 = \text{Total number of eggs} $

Now, we just need to solve for the total number of eggs.

$ E \div 11 = \text{Number of groups} $
$ \text{Number of groups} \times 2 = \text{Total number of eggs} $

Assuming that the number of groups will be a whole number, we can find the total number of eggs.

Let's say the total number of eggs is ""X"":

$ E \div 11 = \text{Number of groups} $
$ \text{Number of groups} \times 2 = X $

Now, we can use these equations to find the total number of eggs.

$ E \div 11 = \text{Number of groups} $
$ \text{Number of groups} \times 2 = X $

We need to isolate ""X,"" so we can start by solving for the number of groups:

$ E \div 11 = \text{Number of groups} $

And then use that value to find ""X"":

$ \text{Number of groups} \times 2 = X $

Now, let's calculate ""X.""

Let's say, for example, Rebecca has 22 eggs.

$ 22 \div 11 = 2 $
$ 2 \times 2 = 4 $

So, if Rebecca has 22 eggs and wants to split them into groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group, she has a total of 4 eggs.

1. The total earnings in 30 days is $420.

2. Together with the ring toss game, they earned $22.

To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we'll first subtract the earnings from the game they made together with the $22 from the total earnings of $420:

Total earnings - Earnings from other games = Earnings from the ring toss game
$420 - $22 = Earnings from the ring toss game

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the ring toss game per day by dividing the total earnings from the ring toss game by the number of days (30):

Earnings from the ring toss game / Number of days = Earnings per day
(Earnings from the ring toss game) / 30 = Earnings per day

Total initial items: $40 + 54 = 94$
