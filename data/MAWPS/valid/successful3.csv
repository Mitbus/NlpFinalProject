julia played tag with 5 kids on monday . she played tag with some more kids on tuesday . if she played with a total of 15 kids how many kids did she play with on tuesday ?,"Let's assume that Julia played with x kids on Tuesday. 

We know that Julia played with 5 kids on Monday, so the total number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday is 5 + x. 

According to the problem, the total number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday is 15. 

So we can set up the equation 5 + x = 15 to represent the situation.

Simplifying the equation gives us: 

x = 15 - 5 = << 15 - 5 = 10 >> 10

Therefore, Julia played with 10 kids on Tuesday.

randy has 97 blocks . he uses some blocks to build a tower . if there are 72 blocks left how many blocks did he use to build the tower ?,"To find out how many blocks Randy used to build the tower, we can subtract the number of blocks left from the total number of blocks he had initially.

Total number of blocks Randy had = 97
Number of blocks left = 72

To find the number of blocks Randy used, we can subtract the number of blocks left from the total number of blocks:

 97 - 72 = << 97 - 72 = 25 >> 25 

Therefore, Randy used 25 blocks to build the tower.

randy has 58 blocks . he uses 27 blocks to build a tower and 53 blocks to build a house . how many blocks did he use to build the tower and the house altogether ?,"To find out how many blocks Randy used to build the tower and the house altogether, we need to add the number of blocks he used for each separately.

Randy used 27 blocks to build the tower and 53 blocks to build the house. 

To find the total number of blocks used, we can add these two numbers together:

27 + 53 = << 27 + 53 = 80 >> 80

Therefore, Randy used a total of 80 blocks to build the tower and the house altogether.

they decided to hold the party in their backyard . they have 2 sets of tables each having the same number of chairs . if there are a total of 12 chairs in the backyard how many chairs are there for each table ?,"Let's assume the number of chairs in each set of tables is represented by the variable x. Since they have 2 sets of tables, the total number of chairs can be calculated by multiplying the number of chairs in each set by the number of sets, which gives us 2x. 

According to the problem, the total number of chairs in the backyard is 12. So we can set up the equation:

2x = 12

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 12 / 2

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = 12 / 2 = << 12 / 2 = 6 >> 6

Therefore, there are 6 chairs for each table.

faye was placing 12 pencils equally into 3 rows . how many pencils did she place in each row ?,"To find out how many pencils Faye placed in each row, we can divide the total number of pencils by the number of rows.

Total number of pencils = 12
Number of rows = 3

To divide 12 equally into 3 rows, we perform the division:

12 / 3 = << 12 / 3 = 4 >> 4

Therefore, Faye placed 4 pencils in each row.

the school is planning a field trip . the school has 67 classrooms . there are 66 students in each classroom in the school . if there are 6 seats on each school bus how many buses are needed to take the trip ?,"To find out how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to determine the total number of students and then divide it by the number of seats on each bus.

First, let's calculate the total number of students in the school. We know that there are 67 classrooms and 66 students in each classroom. To find the total number of students, we can multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom:

 67 * 66 = << 67 * 66 = 4422 >> 4422 

So, there are a total of 4422 students in the school.

Next, we need to determine how many buses are needed to transport these students. Since each bus has 6 seats, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus:

4422 / 6 = << 4422 / 6 = 737 >> 737

Therefore, we would need 737 buses to accommodate all the students for the field trip.

rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 4 groups . rebecca has 8 eggs and 6 marbles . how many eggs will each group have ?,"To find out how many eggs each group will have, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of groups.

Rebecca has 8 eggs and wants to split them into 4 groups. 

To divide the eggs equally among the groups, we can use the division operation: 

 8 / 4 = << 8 / 4 = 2 >> 2 

Therefore, each group will have 2 eggs.

rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into 3 groups . rebecca has 4 marbles and 15 eggs . how many eggs will each group have ?,"To find out how many eggs each group will have, we need to divide the total number of eggs by the number of groups.

Given that Rebecca has 15 eggs and wants to split them into 3 groups, we can use division to find the answer.

Dividing 15 eggs into 3 groups, we get:

15 / 3 = << 15 / 3 = 5 >> 5

Therefore, each group will have 5 eggs.

luke played a trivia game and scored 154 points . if he gained the 11 points in each round how many rounds did he play ?,"To find the number of rounds Luke played, we can divide his total score by the number of points gained in each round.

Let's represent the number of rounds as r.

We know that Luke gained 11 points in each round, so the equation becomes:

11r = 154

To solve for r, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 11:

11r / 11 = 154 / 11

Simplifying, we have:

r = 154 / 11 = << 154 / 11 = 14 >> 14

Therefore, Luke played 14 rounds.

the cave is 1218 feet deep and they are already at 849 feet . if they are travelling at speed of 17 how much farther until they reach the end of the cave ?,"To find out how much farther they need to travel until they reach the end of the cave, we can subtract the depth they have already traveled from the total depth of the cave.

Total depth of the cave: 1218 feet
Depth already traveled: 849 feet

To find the remaining distance, we subtract the depth already traveled from the total depth of the cave:

1218 - 849 = << 1218 - 849 = 369 >> 369

Therefore, they need to travel an additional 369 feet until they reach the end of the cave.
