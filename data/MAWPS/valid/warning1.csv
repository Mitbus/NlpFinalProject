Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 = 17 - x pieces of candy left.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

-x = -9

According to the problem, Bobby has 20 pieces of candy left. So we can set up the equation: 

32 - x = 20

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 32 from both sides:

32 - x - 32 = 20 - 32
-x = -12

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by -1:

To find the total number of peaches:
Total number of peaches = Number of red peaches + Number of yellow peaches + Number of green peaches

Substituting the given values:
Total number of peaches = 7 + 15 + 8

Calculating:
Total number of peaches = 30

Therefore, there are 30 peaches in the basket.

Jerry initially had 7 action figures and 2 books on the shelf. 

So, the number of action figures minus the number of books is:

$7 - 2 = 5$

Later, Jerry added 4 more books to the shelf. 

Therefore, the final number of books on the shelf is:

$2 + 4 = 6$

Now, we can calculate how many more action figures than books were on Jerry's shelf by subtracting the number of books from the number of action figures:

$5 - 6 = -1$

The result is -1, which means there was one less action figure than book on Jerry's shelf.

3. Later, he removed some of the old action figures from the shelf.
4. The current number of action figures on the shelf is given as 6.
5. To find out how many action figures Jerry removed, we need to subtract the current number (6) from the total number (7).
6. Therefore, Jerry removed 7 - 6 = 1 action figure from the shelf.

Initially, Rachel had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some apples, so the number of apples left on the tree is given by 4 - x. 

According to the problem, there are now 2 apples left on the tree. So we can set up the equation:

4 - x = 2

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides:

4 - x - 4 = 2 - 4

Simplifying both sides gives us:

-x = -2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-2)

Simplifying further gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, Rachel picked 2 apples.

According to the problem, there are 182 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. So we can write:

$m = 182$

It is also mentioned that there were other students who suggested adding bacon to the menu. The problem states that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. 

So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon can be represented as ""m + 166"".

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested bacon and mashed potatoes combined is:

$m + (m + 166)$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$2m + 166$

Since we know that a total of 182 students suggested mashed potatoes, we can set up an equation:

$2m + 166 = 182$

To solve for ""m"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us:

$2m = 182 - 166$

Simplifying further:

$2m = 16$

Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of ""m"":

$m = \frac{16}{2}$

$m = 8$

Therefore, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.

To find out how many students suggested bacon, we substitute the value of ""m"" into our expression for the number of students who suggested bacon:

$m + 166 = 8 + 166$

Calculating this expression gives us:

$m + 166 = ####$

Now, let's calculate the total number of pupils:

According to the given information, Edward spent $4$ to buy books and $3$ to buy pens. So we can write two equations based on this:

Equation 1: $x + y = 12$ (Edward has a total of $12$ after buying books and pens)
Equation 2: $x = 4 + y$ (Edward spent $4$ on books)

To find the values of $x$ and $y$, we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

$(4 + y) + y = 12$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$4 + 2y = 12$

Subtracting $4$ from both sides:

$2y = 8$

Dividing both sides by $2$, we find:

$y = 4$

Now that we know the value of $y$, we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find the value of $x$:

$x = 4 + 4$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$x = 8$

Therefore, Edward spent $8$ on books and $4$ on pens.

1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to subtract 2 inches from the grasshopper's jump:

3. Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 2 inches.

Substituting the value of the grasshopper's jump (13 inches) into the equation:

4. Frog's jump = 13 inches - 2 inches.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

5. Frog's jump = 11 inches.

Therefore, the frog jumped 11 inches.

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Therefore, the grasshopper's jump can be represented as $x + 4$.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump can be represented as $x - 44$.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up an equation:

$(x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19$

Simplifying this equation:

$x + x + 4 - 44 = 19$

Combining like terms:

$2x - 40 = 19$

Adding 40 to both sides of the equation:

$2x = 59$

Dividing both sides by 2:

$x = \frac{59}{2}$

Therefore, the frog jumped $\frac{59}{2}$ inches.

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Let's represent the distance jumped by the frog as ""x"" inches. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x + 25"" inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x - 16"" inches.

Now, we can calculate how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse by subtracting their distances:

Distance jumped by grasshopper - Distance jumped by mouse
= (x + 25) - (x - 16)

Simplifying this expression:

= x + 25 - x + 16
= x - x + 25 + 16
= 41

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.

We know that Dan had 3 left with him after he bought the candy bar, so we can set up the equation: $4 - c = 3$.

To find the value of $c$, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: $4 - 3 = c$.

Simplifying this equation gives us: $1 = c$.

Therefore, the candy bar cost $1.

$7 - 2 = 5$

Therefore, Dan spent $5 more on chocolate than he did on the candy bar.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 books left.

According to the problem, he had 62 books left after giving away and selling some books. So we can set up the equation:

(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:

108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

We know that Paul initially had 136 books and he sold some of them, leaving him with 27 books. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

136 - x = 27

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 27 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

136 - 27 = x

Simplifying the left side gives us: 

109 = x

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books.

1. We know that Steven has 14 peaches.
2. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can subtract 6 from the number of peaches Steven has: $14 - 6 = 8$.
3. Jake also has 3 more peaches than Jill, so we can add 3 to the number of peaches Jill has: $8 + 3 = 11$.

Therefore, Jill has 11 peaches.

Given information:
Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches.

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 3 from the number of peaches Steven has.
Peaches Jake has = 15 - 3 = 12

Similarly, Jake has 4 more apples than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of apples Jake has by adding 4 to the number of apples Steven has.
Apples Jake has = 19 + 4 = 23

Now, let's compare the number of apples and peaches Steven has:
Apples - Peaches = 19 - 15 = 4

Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.

Initially, Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He then added 89 new apps, resulting in a total of 21 + 89 = 110 apps.

After deleting some apps, he had 24 left. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

110 - x = 24

To find the value of ""x,"" we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

110 - x - 24 = 24 - 24
86 - x = 0

To isolate ""x,"" we subtract 86 from both sides:

86 - x - 86 = 0 - 86
-x = -86

Finally, to solve for ""x,"" we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-86)
x = 86

Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we subtract the number of deleted apps from the number of added apps:

After deleting some apps, Dave had 14 left.

Josh had 22 marbles in his collection.
He found 13 more marbles.
He also lost 5 marbles.

To calculate the current number of marbles, we can start with the initial number of marbles and then add the ones he found while subtracting the ones he lost.

Initial number of marbles: 22
Marbles found: +13
Marbles lost: -5

To find the current number of marbles, we can perform the following calculation:

$22 + 13 - 5 = 30$

Therefore, Josh currently has 30 marbles.

Given:
- Initially, Haley had grown 3 trees.
- After the typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon.

Total number of trees before the typhoon = Initial trees + Trees that died
Total number of trees before the typhoon = 3 + 13

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees before the typhoon:

$3 + 13 = 16$

So, there were a total of 16 trees before the typhoon.

To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon:

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees before the typhoon - Trees that died
Number of trees that survived = 16 - 13

Now, let's calculate the number of trees that survived:

$16 - 13 = 3$

So, there were 3 trees that survived.

To find how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died:

Number of trees that died more than those that survived = Trees that died - Number of trees that survived
Number of trees that died more than those that survived = 13 - 3

Now, let's calculate how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived:

$13 - 3 = 10$

Therefore, there were 10 more trees that died in the typhoon than those that survived.

The total number of trees initially is given as 11.

The number of trees that died is given as 2.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees initially:

$11 - 2 = 9$

Therefore, 9 more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.

Let's assume that the number of days required to harvest 24 sacks is represented by ""x"". 

We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day, so the proportion can be set up as:

$\frac{8}{1} = \frac{24}{x}$

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply:

$8x = 24$

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

$x = \frac{24}{8}$

Simplifying the right side gives us:

$x = 3$

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.

First, we know that they have 12 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. So the total number of chairs from the sets of tables is $12 \times 14$.

Next, we are told that there are also 6 extra chairs. 

To find the total number of chairs, we add the number of chairs from the sets of tables to the number of extra chairs: $(12 \times 14) + 6$.

Calculating this expression gives us the total number of chairs they have for the guests.

Let's denote the amount of wax required by feathers as ""x"".

Therefore, the equation becomes:

To find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we can use the formula:

Total number of drums = Number of drums per day × Number of days

Substituting the given values into the formula:

Total number of drums = 244 × 146

Calculating this expression:

Total number of drums = 35624

According to the information given, Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started jogging, she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week.

To find out how much she weighed before starting to jog, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her current weight.

Total weight lost = weight lost in the first week + weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 62 kilograms + 140 kilograms

Now, we can calculate Jessie's weight before starting to jog by adding the total weight lost to her current weight:

Jessie's weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Total weight lost
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + (62 kilograms + 140 kilograms)

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + 202 kilograms

Adding the two values together:
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 211 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before starting to jog.

Number of hiding alligators = 51

To find the number of animals that were not hiding, we can subtract the sum of hiding snakes and hiding alligators from the total number of animals.

Number of animals not hiding = Total number of animals - Number of hiding snakes - Number of hiding alligators

Number of animals not hiding = 79 - 24 - 51

Given:
- Number of action figures that can fit on each shelf: 10
- Total number of action figures in Adam's room: 8

To find the total number of shelves, we divide the total number of action figures by the number of action figures that can fit on each shelf:

$ \text{Total shelves} = \frac{\text{Total action figures}}{\text{Action figures per shelf}} $

Substituting the given values:

$ \text{Total shelves} = \frac{8}{10} $

Simplifying the division:

$ \text{Total shelves} = 0.8 $

Therefore, Adam's room has a total of 0.8 shelves.
