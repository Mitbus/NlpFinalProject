y = 14

We also know that Julia spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. We can write the equation:

It is also mentioned that Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, after losing 3 marbles, Doug would have had ""x - 3"" marbles.

Given that Ed had 27 marbles, we can set up the equation:

$x + 5 = 27$

To find the initial number of marbles Doug had, we need to solve for ""x"" in the equation above.

After losing some marbles at the playground, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. This means that Ed currently has $x + 8$ marbles.

To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of marbles Ed had and the current number of marbles he has. 

The initial number of marbles Ed had was $x + 19$, and the current number of marbles he has is $x + 8$. Therefore, the number of marbles Ed lost can be calculated as:

$(x + 19) - (x + 8)$

Simplifying this expression:

$x + 19 - x - 8$

According to the question, we know that Ed had 91 marbles. So we can set up the equation:

$x + 30 - 21 = 91$

Simplifying this equation step by step:

$x + 9 = 91$

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

$x = 82$

Therefore, Doug has 82 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug, we subtract Doug's number of marbles from Ed's:

According to the information given, Edward spent 9 units of money. So, if we subtract 9 from the initial amount, we will get the remaining amount after the first expenditure.

Initial amount - 9 = Remaining amount after first expenditure

Next, it is mentioned that Edward spent 8 more units of money. So, if we subtract another 8 from the remaining amount after the first expenditure, we will get the final amount of money Edward has now.

Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8 = Final amount

According to the problem, the final amount is 17 units of money. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8 = 17

To find the initial amount Edward had before spending his money, we need to solve this equation for the remaining amount after the first expenditure.

Let's add 8 to both sides of the equation:

(Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8) + 8 = 17 + 8

Simplifying,

Remaining amount after first expenditure = 25

Now, to find the initial amount Edward had before spending his money, we need to add back the initial expenditure of 9 units:

According to the information given, Edward spent a total of $16 to buy 92 books. This can be expressed as the equation:

$16 = 92x$

To find the value of $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 92:

$\frac{16}{92} = \frac{92x}{92}$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$\frac{2}{11} = x$

So, each book costs $\frac{2}{11}$.

Now, we know that Edward currently has 6 books. To find out how much money he had before spending it, we need to calculate the total cost of those 6 books.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the cost per book ($\frac{2}{11}$) by the number of books (6):

$\frac{2}{11} \times 6 = \frac{12}{11}$

Therefore, Edward had $\frac{12}{11}$ before he spent his money.

The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can represent the distance covered by the frog as $25 + 32$.

Now, to find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to subtract 26 inches from the distance covered by the frog: $(25 + 32) - 26$.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Let's represent the distance jumped by the frog as ""x"" inches. According to the second statement, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x + 25"" inches.

According to the third statement, the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x - 16"" inches.

Now we can calculate how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse by subtracting their distances:

Distance jumped by grasshopper - Distance jumped by mouse
= (x + 25) - (x - 16)

Simplifying this expression:

= x + 25 - x + 16
= x - x + 25 + 16
= 41

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.

The total amount Dan spent on candy bars is given by multiplying the cost of each candy bar ($6) by the number of candy bars he bought (x):

Total amount = $6 * x

We also know that each candy bar costs $3. So, we can set up an equation:

$6 * x = Total amount

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:
(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:
108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

We are told that he now has 116 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

71 - x + 38 = 116

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we need to solve for x.

Combining like terms on the left side of the equation:

109 - x = 116

Subtracting 109 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 7

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:

x = -7

Since we cannot have a negative number of books sold, it means that Paul must have bought more books than he sold. To find out how many more books he bought, we take the absolute value of x:

3. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
4. After all these actions, there are now 23 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses and the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 2
Number of roses thrown away = 4
Total number of roses in the vase = 23

So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can use the following equation:

Substituting the given values:

$ 23 = 2 + \text{Number of roses cut} - 4 $

Now, let's solve for the unknown variable (Number of roses cut):

$ 23 = 2 + \text{Number of roses cut} - 4 $

Combining like terms:

According to the given information, Dave initially had 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys. This can be represented as $7 - x$, where $x$ is the number of tickets he used.

We are also told that Dave still has 2 tickets left. So, we can set up the equation:

$7 - x = 2$

To find the value of $x$, we need to solve this equation for $x$. 

Adding $x$ to both sides of the equation:

$7 - x + x = 2 + x$

Simplifying:

$7 = 2 + x$

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

$7 - 2 = 2 + x - 2$

Simplifying:

$5 = x$

Therefore, Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys.

$ 74 \times 51 = 3774 $

So, they will have harvested a total of 3774 sacks in 51 days.

Next, let's calculate the total number of sacks discarded in 51 days. Since they discard 71 sacks per day, we can multiply this by the number of days:

First, let's find the number of flower beds. We know that they planted a total of 55 seeds and put 15 seeds in each flower bed. To find the number of flower beds, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per bed:

$ \text{Number of flower beds} = \frac{55}{15} $

Now, let's find out how many flowers grew in each flower bed. We are given that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of flowers by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of flowers that grew in each bed:

$ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of flower beds} \times \text{Number of flowers that grew in each bed} $

Let's calculate it step by step:

$ \text{Number of flower beds} = \frac{55}{15} = 3.6667 $ (rounded to four decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fraction or decimal value for the number of flower beds, we will round it down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 3 flower beds.

$ \text{Total number of flowers} = 3 \times 60 = 180 $

Therefore, Paige and her mom grew a total of 180 flowers.

Let's assume there are ""x"" houses in a block.

The mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house, so the total number of junk mails given to all houses in a block is 14 * x.

The mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, so the total number of junk mails given to all blocks is 2 * (number of blocks).

Since each block contains ""x"" houses, the total number of blocks is equal to the total number of houses divided by ""x"".

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

14 * x = 2 * (total number of houses / x)

To solve for ""x"", we can cross multiply:

14 * x * x = 2 * total number of houses

Simplifying further:

Dividing both sides by 2:

7x^2 = total number of houses

Now, let's consider the given information that the mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block. This implies that there are at least some houses in a block. Therefore, the total number of houses must be greater than or equal to 14.

Let's substitute some values for the total number of houses and see if it satisfies our equation:

If we assume there are 14 houses in a block, then:

7(1764) = 42
12348 = 42

This is not true since 12348 does not equal 42.

We can continue this process of substituting values, but we can see that none of the assumed values for the total number of houses satisfy the equation. This means that there"

Luke scored 84 points after playing 2 rounds of a trivia game. 

Let's represent the number of points Luke scored per round as ""x"".

In the first round, Luke scored ""x"" points.
In the second round, Luke also scored ""x"" points.

Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored can be expressed as:
Total points = Points in first round + Points in second round
Total points = x + x

Since we know that the total number of points Luke scored is 84, we can write the equation:
2x = 84

To solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
2x/2 = 84/2
x = 42

Hence, Luke scored 42 points per round.

Total score = Points per round × Number of rounds
78 = 3x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

78/3 = (3x)/3
26 = x

Therefore, Luke played 26 rounds in the trivia game.

Let's assign variables to the unknown quantities:
- Let A represent the number of apples Adam has.
- Let J represent the number of apples Jackie has.

From the given information, we can form equations:

1. ""Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie."" can be written as A = J + 4.
