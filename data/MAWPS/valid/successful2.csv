- The grasshopper jumped 36 inches.
- The frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to add the additional distance it jumped compared to the grasshopper.

According to the given information, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so the grasshopper's jump distance is x + 19 inches.
The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so the mouse's jump distance is x - 12 inches.
We know that the grasshopper's jump distance is 39 inches.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 19 = 39.
Simplifying the equation, we have: x = 39 - 19 = << 39 - 19 = 20 >> 20.
We find: x = 20.
So, the frog jumped 20 inches.
To find the distance the mouse jumped, we substitute the value of x into the expression for the mouse's jump distance: 20 - 12 = x into the expression for the mouse's jump distance: x = 20 - 12.
Calculating, we find: 20 - 12 = << 20 - 12 = 8 >> 8
Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

next on his checklist are wax to stick the feathers together and colors to paint them . he needs a total of 49 g of colors to paint them . if the feathers require 288 g of wax and right now he just needs 260 g how many grams of wax does he already have ?,"Let's denote the number of grams of wax he already has as x. 

We know that the feathers require 288 g of wax and he currently needs 260 g. This can be expressed as an equation: 

x + 260 = 288

To find the value of x, we can subtract 260 from both sides of the equation:

x + 260 - 260 = 288 - 260

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

x = 288 - 260 = << 288 - 260 = 28 >> 28

Therefore, he already has 28 grams of wax.
