Then, he bought 3 more balloons at the park. To find out how many balloons Allan brought to the park in total, we can add the number of balloons he initially brought to the number of balloons he bought at the park.

Number of balloons Allan initially brought = 5
Number of balloons Allan bought at the park = 3

To find the total number of balloons Allan brought to the park, we can add these two numbers together.

Total number of balloons Allan brought to the park = 5 + 3 = 8

Therefore, Allan brought 8 balloons to the park.

Since Allan brought 5 balloons, the total number of balloons brought by Allan and Jake is 5 + x. According to the problem, the total number of balloons brought by Allan and Jake is 6. 

Therefore, we can write the equation: 5 + x = 6.

To find the value of x, we can subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

5 + x - 5 = 6 - 5
x = 1

Thus, Jake brought 1 balloon to the park.

Given that Ed had 45 marbles, we can set up an equation: $D + 10 = 45$.

$D - 27 = E + 9$   (Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more marbles)

We can solve these equations to find the values of $D$ and $E$.

First, let's substitute the value of $E$ from the first equation into the second equation:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

Simplifying further, we get:

Edward spent $6 on books and $16 on pens, so the total amount he spent can be represented as $6 + $16 = $22. 

Now, we know that after spending this money, Edward has $19 left. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - $22 = $19. 

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding $22 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - $22 + $22 = $19 + $22. 

Simplifying this equation gives us: x = $41. 

Therefore, Edward had $41 before he spent his money.

So David did 70 push-ups.

Next, let's find out how many crunches David did. We know that Zachary did 14 crunches, and David did 10 less crunches than Zachary.

To find the number of crunches David did, we can subtract 10 from the number of crunches Zachary did:

$ 14 - 10 = 4 $

So David did 4 crunches.

Finally, let's summarize the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did:

Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.

Given:
- The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
- The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog.

Let's calculate the frog's jump first:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
Frog's jump = 24 inches + 33 inches

Now, let's calculate the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 5 inches
Mouse's jump = (24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches

Finally, let's find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by calculating the difference between their jumps:
Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
Difference = [(24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches] - 24 inches

Simplifying the calculations:
Frog's jump = $24 + 33$
Mouse's jump = $(24 + 33) - 5$
Difference = $[(24 + 33) - 5] - 24$

Calculating each step:
Frog's jump = $57$
Mouse's jump = $52$
Difference = $28$

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

1. The grasshopper jumped 35 inches.
2. The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. To find out how much they jumped altogether, we need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped to the distance the frog jumped.

Let's calculate the distance the frog jumped:
- The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 35 + 4 = 39 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total distance they jumped altogether:
- We need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped (35 inches) to the distance the frog jumped (39 inches).
- 35 + 39 = 74

Therefore, they jumped altogether 74 inches.

Total number of crayons Paul received = 440
Number of crayons Paul gave to his friends = 111
Number of crayons Paul lost = 106

To find the number of crayons Paul had left, we can subtract the sum of the crayons he gave to his friends and the crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he received:

Number of crayons Paul had left = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons given to friends - Number of crayons lost

Number of crayons Paul had left = 440 - 111 - 106

Now let's calculate this:

Number of crayons Paul had left = 223

Next, let's find the current difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps. Danny now has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. So the current difference is:

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the initial difference from the current difference:

Step 2: At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus.
$ \text{Number of children who got on the bus} = 40 $

Step 3: After some children got off the bus, there were 2 children remaining on the bus.
$ \text{Number of children remaining on the bus} = 2 $

Step 4: We need to find how many children got off the bus at the bus stop.
To find this, we can subtract the number of children remaining on the bus from the total number of children who were on the bus initially.
$ \text{Number of children got off the bus} = \text{Initial number of children} - \text{Number of children remaining on the bus} $

Step 5: Substitute the given values into the equation.
$ \text{Number of children got off the bus} = 22 - 2 $

Step 6: Perform the subtraction.

Therefore, 20 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

Total number of movies in the 'crazy silly school' series = 8
Number of movies you have already watched = 4

To find the number of movies you still have to watch, we can subtract the number of movies you have already watched from the total number of movies in the series.

Total number of movies - Number of movies already watched = Number of movies still to watch
8 - 4 = 4

Therefore, you still have to watch 4 more movies.

Area = Length * Width
Area = 11 feet * 15 feet

To find the area, we multiply 11 by 15:

Area = 165 square feet

Now, we subtract the area of the carpet Jesse already has (16 square feet) from the total area of the room (165 square feet) to determine how much more carpet she needs:

Additional carpet needed = Total area - Area of carpet already had
Additional carpet needed = 165 square feet - 16 square feet

To find the additional carpet needed, we subtract 16 from 165:

Additional carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 149 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

Given:
Number of people who can ride the wheel at the same time = 18
Number of people each seat can hold = 9

To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel:
Number of seats = Number of people who can ride the wheel / Number of people each seat can hold

Number of seats = 18 / 9

Calculating the division:
Number of seats = 2

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 2 seats.

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

29 - 9 = 20
20 - 1 = 19

Therefore, the grocery store had 19 more bottles of regular soda than diet soda.

1. Calculate the total number of drums of grapes filled in one day: 235 pickers * 221 drums of grapes per day = 51935 drums of grapes per day.
2. Multiply the number of drums of grapes filled per day by the number of days: 51935 drums of grapes per day * 77 days = 3998795 drums of grapes in 77 days.

Therefore, the number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 77 days is 3998795."

Since you had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies is given by $26x$.

You also had 15 candies, which are not cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies and candies is $26x + 15$.

We know that the total number of cookies and candies is 52. So we can set up the equation $26x + 15 = 52$.

To solve for $x$, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: $26x = 52 - 15$.

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us $26x = 37$.

To isolate $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26: $x = \frac{37}{26}$.

Simplifying the fraction gives us $x = 1.42$ (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, each bag contains approximately 1.42 cookies.

To find the number of bags of cookies you have, we can divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of cookies in each bag (1.42):

$52 / 1.42 = 36.62$ (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, you have approximately 36.62 bags of cookies.
