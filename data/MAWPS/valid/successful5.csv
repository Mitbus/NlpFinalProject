there were some roses in the vase . jessica cut 16 more roses from her flower garden and put them in the vase . there are now 23 roses in the vase . how many roses were there in the vase at the beginning ?,"Let's use algebra to solve this problem. We can represent the number of roses in the vase at the beginning as a variable, say R. 

So, at the beginning, there were R roses in the vase. Jessica then cut 16 more roses and put them in the vase, which makes the total number of roses in the vase now equal to R + 16. We know that there are now 23 roses in the vase, so we can set up the equation:

R + 16 = 23

To find the initial number of roses in the vase (R), we need to isolate R on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation:

R + 16 - 16 = 23 - 16

Simplifying this, we get:

R = 23 - 16 = << 23 - 16 = 7 >> 7

So, there were 7 roses in the vase at the beginning.
