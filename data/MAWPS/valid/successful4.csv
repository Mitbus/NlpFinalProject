the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 36 inches . the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?,"Let's denote the distance jumped by the grasshopper as G inches. According to the problem, the frog jumped 17 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the distance jumped by the frog can be represented as G + 17 inches. Similarly, the mouse jumped 15 inches farther than the frog, which means the distance jumped by the mouse can be represented as (G + 17) + 15 inches.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 36 inches, we can substitute G = 36 into the expressions for the frog and the mouse's jumps.

The frog's jump: G + 17 = 36 + 17 << 36 + 17 = 53 >> = 53 inches.

Thus, the frog jumped 53 inches.

1. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
2. The frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 25 + 18 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 25 + 18 + 2 inches.

Now, we can calculate the distance the mouse jumped:

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the total distance the mouse jumped and then subtract the distance the grasshopper jumped. 

Let's calculate the distance each of them jumped:

- The frog jumped 19 (grasshopper's jump) + 10 (extra) = 19 + 10 = << 19 + 10 = 29 >> 29 inches.
- The mouse jumped 29 (frog's jump) + 20 (extra) = 29 + 20 = << 29 + 20 = 49 >> 49 inches.

Now, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

49 (mouse's jump) - 19 (grasshopper's jump) = << 49 - 19 = 30 >> 30

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 35 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much did they jump altogether ?,"It seems there might be a typo in the problem statement, as it mentions that the grasshopper jumped 35 inches and then jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper. It's not clear who the second grasshopper is supposed to be. I assume you meant to say that the frog jumped 4 inches less than the grasshopper. 

Let's calculate the total distance they jumped.

The grasshopper jumped 35 inches, and the frog jumped 4 inches less than the grasshopper.

So, the frog jumped 35 - 4 = 31 inches.

To find the total distance they jumped altogether, we can add the distances jumped by the grasshopper and the frog:

35 + 31 = << 35 + 31 = 66 >> 66

So, they jumped a total of 66 inches altogether.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?,"Let's use algebra to solve this problem step by step. We'll represent the distance the frog jumped as F (in inches).

1. The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, which means the grasshopper's jump can be represented as F + 4.
3. The mouse jumped 44 inches less than the frog, so the mouse's jump can be represented as F - 44.

Now, we have three pieces of information:

- The grasshopper's jump (G) = 19 inches.
- The grasshopper's jump (G) = the frog's jump (F) + 4 inches.
- The mouse's jump (M) = the frog's jump (F) - 44 inches.

We can write these equations:

1. G = 19
2. G = F + 4
3. M = F - 44

We can now use these equations to solve for the frog's jump (F).

First, from equation 2, we know that G = F + 4. Since we know G = 19, we can substitute that into the equation:

19 = F + 4

Now, we can isolate F by subtracting 4 from both sides:

F = 19 - 4 = << 19 - 4 = 15 >> 15

So, the frog jumped 15 inches.

So, you need to calculate: 39 - 17 = << 39 - 17 = 22 >> 22

So, the frog jumped 22 inches farther than the grasshopper.

#### 22"
the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 14 inches . the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.
2. The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 14 + 37 inches.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse jumped (14 + 37) - 16 inches.

Now, let's calculate each of these:

1. Grasshopper's jump: 14 inches
2. Frog's jump: 14 + 37 inches
3. Mouse's jump: (14 + 37) - 16 inches

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump: ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump: ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14 = << ((14 + 37) - 16) - 14 = 21 >> 21

So, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

To find out how much each candy bar costs, we can set up an equation:

Let C represent the cost of one candy bar. We know that the total cost of 2 candy bars is 4, so we can write:

2C = 4

To find the cost of one candy bar, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

C = 4 / 2 = << 4 / 2 = 2 >> = 2

So, each candy bar costs 2.

dan has 5 . he bought a chocolate for 3 and a candy bar for 7 . how much money did he spend to buy candy bar than he did to buy chocolate ?,"Dan had 5 dollars.

He spent 3 dollars on a chocolate and 7 dollars on a candy bar.

To find out how much more he spent on the candy bar compared to the chocolate, we subtract the cost of the chocolate from the cost of the candy bar:

 7 - 3 = << 7 - 3 = 4 >> 4 

Dan spent 4 dollars more on the candy bar than he did on the chocolate.

#### 4"
dan has 4 . he bought a chocolate for 7 and a candy bar for 2 . how much money did he spend to buy chocolate than he did to buy candy bar ?,"To find out how much more money Dan spent on chocolate than on the candy bar, we can subtract the cost of the candy bar from the cost of the chocolate.

1. Dan bought a chocolate for 7.
2. Dan bought a candy bar for 2.

Now, we subtract the cost of the candy bar from the cost of the chocolate:

7 - 2 = << 7 - 2 = 5 >> 5

So, Dan spent 5 more to buy chocolate than he did to buy the candy bar.

there were 7 roses in the vase . jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden which had a total of 59 roses . there are now 20 roses in the vase . how many roses did she cut ?,"Let's break down the information provided step by step:

1. Initially, there were 7 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden, which had a total of 59 roses.
3. After cutting the roses, there are now 20 roses in the vase.

We need to find out how many roses Jessica cut. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Initial roses in the vase + Roses Jessica cut = Roses in the vase after cutting

So, we have:

7 (initial roses) + Roses Jessica cut = 20 (roses in the vase after cutting)

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

Roses Jessica cut = 20 - 7

Now, let's calculate:

 20 - 7 = << 20 - 7 = 13 >> 13 

So, Jessica cut 13 roses from her flower garden.

#### 13"
jessica cut some roses from her flower garden to put in her vase . there are now 19 roses in the vase . if there were 3 roses in the vase initially how many roses did she cut ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 3 roses in the vase.

2. Jessica cut some roses from her flower garden and placed them in the vase.

3. Now, there are 19 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we need to calculate the difference between the current number of roses in the vase and the initial number of roses.

 19 - 3 = << 19 - 3 = 16 >> 16 

So, Jessica cut 16 roses from her garden.

there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase . how many roses did she cut ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase.
2. Jessica then cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.
3. After cutting, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.

We need to find out how many roses Jessica cut. 

Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut as R and the number of orchids Jessica cut as O.

So, we have the following two equations based on the information given:

1. The initial number of roses plus the roses Jessica cut equals the current number of roses: 13 + R = 14
2. The initial number of orchids plus the orchids Jessica cut equals the current number of orchids: 84 + O = 91

Let's solve these equations step by step:

1. 13 + R = 14
   Subtract 13 from both sides to isolate R:
    R = 14 - 13 = << 14 - 13 = 1 >> 1 

2. 84 + O = 91
   Subtract 84 from both sides to isolate O:
    O = 91 - 84 = << 91 - 84 = 7 >>  7 

So, Jessica cut 1 rose and 7 orchids from her garden.

jake has 7 fewer peaches than steven and 9 more peaches than jill . steven has 16 peaches . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Steven has 16 peaches.
2. Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill.

We can start by finding out how many peaches Jill has. Since Jake has 9 more peaches than Jill, and we know Steven has 16 peaches, we can calculate Jill's peaches:

Jill's peaches = Steven's peaches - 9
Jill's peaches = 16 - 9 = << 16 - 9 = 7 >> 7 peaches

Now that we know Jill has 7 peaches, and Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven, we can calculate how many peaches Jake has:

Jake's peaches = Steven's peaches - 7
Jake's peaches = 16 - 7 = << 16 - 7 = 9 >> 9 peaches

So, Jake has 9 peaches.

#### 9"
jake has 7 fewer peaches than steven and 8 more peaches than jill . steven has 17 peaches . how many peaches does jill have ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. We are given that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as Steven's peaches minus 7: Jake = Steven - 7.

2. We are also given that Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill. So, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as Jill's peaches plus 8: Jake = Jill + 8.

3. We know that Steven has 17 peaches: Steven = 17.

Now, we can set up two equations using the information we have:

Jake = Steven - 7
Jake = Jill + 8

Since we know that Steven has 17 peaches, we can substitute 17 for Steven in the first equation:

Jake = 17 - 7 = << 17 - 7 = 10 >> 10

Now that we know Jake has 10 peaches, we can use this information to find out how many peaches Jill has. We can substitute 10 for Jake in the second equation:

10 = Jill + 8

Subtract 8 from both sides to find Jill's peaches:

Jill = 10 - 8 = << 10 - 8 = 2 >> 2

So, Jill has 2 peaches.

- Steven has 12 (Jill's peaches) + 15 (more peaches) = 12 + 15 = << 12 + 15 = 27 >> 27 peaches.
- Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven, which means he has 27 - 16 = << 27 - 16 = 11 >> 11 peaches.

Now, let's calculate how many more peaches Jill has than Jake:

- Jill has 12 peaches, and Jake has 11 peaches.

robin has some packages of gum . there are 7 pieces in each package . robin has 6 extra pieces of gum . in all the number of pieces of gums robin has is 41 . how many packages does robin have ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each package of gum contains 7 pieces.
2. Robin has 6 extra pieces of gum.

To find out how many packages Robin has, we need to determine the number of packages that account for the 6 extra pieces and the remaining pieces that make up a total of 41 pieces of gum.

Let P represent the number of packages Robin has.

So, the total number of pieces of gum can be calculated as follows:
Total pieces of gum = Number of packages * Pieces per package + Extra pieces
Total pieces of gum = 7P + 6

Now, we know that the total number of pieces of gum Robin has is 41, so we can set up an equation:

7P + 6 = 41

To solve for P (the number of packages Robin has), we can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:

7P =  41 - 6 = << 41 - 6 = 35 >> 35

Now, we can isolate P by dividing both sides by 7:

P = 35 / 7 = << 35 / 7 = 5 >> 5

So, Robin has 5 packages of gum.
