an industrial machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today . it can make 2 shirts a minute . how many minutes did the machine work today ?,"The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today. To find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to determine the difference in the number of shirts made between yesterday and today.

The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today, so the difference is 9 - 8 = 1 shirt.

Since the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, we can divide the difference in shirts made by the machine's production rate to find the number of minutes it worked today.

1 shirt / 2 shirts per minute = 0.5 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for 0.5 minutes today.

danny collects bottle caps and wrappers . he found 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers at the park . now he has 11 wrappers and 12 bottle caps in his collection . how many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now ?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.

Danny initially found 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers at the park. So, the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers at the park is:

58 - 25 = <<58 - 25 = 33>> 33

Now, we need to consider the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny currently has in his collection. He has 11 wrappers and 12 bottle caps. So, the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers in his collection is:

12 - 11 = <<12 - 11 = 1>> 1

To find the total difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny has now, we add the difference from the park to the difference from his collection:

33 + 1 = <<33 + 1 = 34>> 34

Therefore, Danny has 34 more bottle caps than wrappers now.

baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes . if he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries how many more pastries than cakes did baker make ?,"To find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we need to calculate the difference between the number of pastries and cakes he made.

Baker initially made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. 
He then sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries.

To determine the difference, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made, and subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made.

Number of pastries made: 134
Number of cakes made: 11

Number of cakes sold: 140
Number of pastries sold: 92

Difference in pastries: 134 - 92 = <<134 - 92 = 42>> 42
Difference in cakes: 11 - 140 = <<11 - 140 = -129>> -129

Since we are interested in the difference in pastries than cakes, we disregard the negative sign for the difference in cakes.

Therefore, Baker made 42 more pastries than cakes.

41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning . 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon . how many campers went rowing and hiking in all ?,"To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Given:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 41
Number of campers who went hiking in the morning = 4
Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 26

To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon:

Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon
Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = 41 + 26

Calculating this expression gives us:

Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = 67

ed had 12 more marbles than doug . ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 17 marbles how many marbles does doug have now ?,"Let's assume that Doug has x marbles.
According to the given information, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 12 marbles.
Ed lost 20 marbles at the playground, so the number of marbles Ed has now is (x + 12) - 20.
We are also given that Ed has 17 marbles, so we can set up the equation:
(x + 12) - 20 = 17
Simplifying the equation:
x + 12 - 20 = 17
x - 8 = 17
Adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
x - 8 + 8 = 17 + 8
x = 25
Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now.

because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . if 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon while 351 suggested adding only bacon to the menu how many students suggested adding bacon ?,"Let's assume that the number of students who suggested adding bacon is represented by the variable <<x>>.

According to the given information, 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon, and 351 students suggested adding only bacon to the menu.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

<<x>> (students who suggested adding bacon) + 218 (students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon) = 351 (students who suggested adding only bacon)

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 218 from both sides of the equation:

<<x>> = 351 - 218

Now we can calculate the value of <<x>>:

<<x>> = 133

Therefore, 133 students suggested adding bacon.

a mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block . if the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block . how many houses are there in a block ?,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given in the problem statement.

The mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block. If the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, this means he is giving a total of 2 * 14 = 28 junk mails to each block.

Therefore, if we let <<x>> represent the number of houses in a block, we can set up the following equation:

14x = <<14x = 28>> 28

To solve for <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14:

x = <<x = 28 / 14>> 28 / 14

This will give us the number of houses in a block.

at the zoo a cage had snakes and alligators . the total number of animals in the cage was 79 . if 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding how many animals were not hiding in all ?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the information given in the problem statement and apply simple arithmetic operations.

The total number of animals in the cage is 79. This is the sum of all the animals, regardless of whether they are hiding or not. We also know that 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding, meaning they were not visible. 

We can calculate the number of alligators and snakes that were not hiding by subtracting the number of hiding alligators and snakes from the total number of each. 

For the alligators, we subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total number of alligators:

 51 - 24 = << 51 - 24 = 27 >> 27 

For the snakes, we subtract the number of hiding snakes from the total number of snakes:

 24 - 24 = << 24 - 24 = 0 >> 0 

Since there are no snakes that were not hiding, this makes sense. 

Therefore, there were 27 alligators and 0 snakes that were not hiding. 

So, the answer is:

dave had 15 apps on his phone . he added 71 new apps . after deleting some he had 14 left . how many more apps did he delete than he added ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

Dave initially had 15 apps on his phone.
He added 71 new apps.
After deleting some apps, he was left with 14 apps.

To find out how many more apps Dave deleted than he added, we need to calculate the difference between the number of apps he deleted and the number of apps he added.

Let's represent the number of apps Dave deleted as ""x"".

The total number of apps Dave had after adding new apps is given by:
15 + 71 = 86

Since he ended up with 14 apps after deleting some, we can set up the equation:
86 - x = 14

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
86 - x - 14 = 14 - 14
72 - x = 0

Now, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 72 from both sides of the equation:
72 - x - 72 = 0 - 72
-x = -72

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 (to get rid of the negative sign):
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-72)
x = 72

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 more apps than he added.

#### 72"

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar . she already put in 5 cups of flour . how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now ?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the cups of flour and the cups of sugar in the cake recipe. 

The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Mary has already put in 5 cups of flour. 

First, we need to calculate how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed in the recipe. 

 14 - 5 = << 14 - 5 = 9 >> 9 

So, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour.

Next, we need to calculate how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of sugar in the recipe from the amount of sugar already added (which is the same as the amount of flour added because the recipe calls for the same amount of flour and sugar). 

 6 - 5 = << 6 - 5 = 1 >> 1 

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar.

Finally, we need to find out how many more cups of flour than sugar Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of sugar from the amount of flour.

 9 - 1 = << 9 - 1 = 8 >> 8 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 8 more cups of flour than sugar to the cake.

there were 3 dollars in olivia 's wallet . she collected 49 more dollars from an atm . after she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left . how much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet.
She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM.
After visiting a supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected and the amount she had left.

Amount collected at the ATM = Initial amount + Amount collected = <<3 + >>49 = <<52
Amount spent at the supermarket = Amount collected - Amount left = >>52 - 49 = <<49 = >> 3

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we subtract the amount spent from the amount collected:

Amount collected at the ATM - Amount spent at the supermarket = <<52 - >>3 = <<49

Therefore, Olivia collected >>49 more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.

dave had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone . after deleting some apps and files he had 21 apps and 4 files left . how many more apps than files does he have left on the phone ?,"To solve the math problem, we need to find out how many more apps Dave has left on his phone compared to the number of files. 

First, let's determine the number of apps Dave had initially. We know that he had 15 apps. 

Next, we need to find out how many apps are left on his phone after he deleted some. We know that he has 21 apps left. 

To find out how many more apps he has left, we subtract the initial number of apps from the number of apps left. 

 21 - 15 = << 21 - 15 = 6 >> 6 

So, Dave has 6 more apps than he initially had.

Now, let's find out how many files Dave had initially. We know that he had 24 files.

Next, we need to find out how many files are left on his phone after he deleted some. We know that he has 4 files left.

To find out how many more files he has left, we subtract the initial number of files from the number of files left.

 4 - 24 = << 4 - 24 = -20 >> -20 

So, Dave has 20 fewer files than he initially had.

Finally, to find out how many more apps than files Dave has left, we subtract the number of files he has left from the number of apps he has left.

 6 - (-20) = << 6 - (-20) = 26 >> 26 

So, Dave has 26 more apps than files left on his phone.

a waiter had 13 customers . after some left he got 4 new customers . if he still had 9 customers how many customers left ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, the waiter had 13 customers.
2. After some customers left, he got 4 new customers.
3. If he still had 9 customers, we need to find out how many customers left.

To find the number of customers who left, we can subtract the number of remaining customers from the initial number of customers.

Initial number of customers = 13
Number of new customers = 4
Remaining customers = 9

Number of customers who left = Initial number of customers - Remaining customers

Number of customers who left = 13 - 9

Calculating this expression gives us:

Number of customers who left = 4

According to the information given, the feathers require a total of 288 g of wax. He currently needs 260 g, which means he still needs an additional 28 g of wax.

Since he needs a total of 49 g of colors to paint the feathers, we can set up the following equation:

x + 260 + 28 = 288

Simplifying this equation, we have:

x + 288 = 288

Subtracting 288 from both sides, we get:

x = 0

Therefore, he already has 0 grams of wax.

The next day, she found 4 more bags worth of cans. So, the total number of bags she had on Tuesday would be x + 4.

We are given that she had a total of 8 bags altogether. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + (x + 4) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 4 = 8

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2

Therefore, Tiffany had 2 bags of cans on Monday.

dan has 4 . he bought 99 candy bar for 3 each one costing the same amount of money . how much money is left ?,"To find out how much money is left after Dan bought 99 candy bars for <<3 each, we need to calculate the total cost of the candy bars and subtract it from the initial amount of money Dan had.

The total cost of the candy bars can be calculated by multiplying the price of each candy bar (>>3) by the number of candy bars (99). This can be represented as:

3 * 99 = <<3 * 99 = >> 297

Now, we need to subtract this total cost from the initial amount of money Dan had (<<4). This can be represented as:

>>4 - 297 = <<297 = ->> -293

Since the result is negative, it means that Dan doesn't have enough money to cover the cost of the candy bars. Therefore, there is no money left.

paul had 21 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones . if he has 15 books now how many more books did he sell than he bought ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Paul initially had 21 books.
2. He sold some books in a garage sale, so we subtract the number of books he sold from his initial number of books: <<21 - x>>, where <<x>> represents the number of books he sold.
3. After selling some books, Paul bought 42 new ones, so we add 42 to the number of books he has left: <<(21 - x) + 42>>.
4. We know that Paul currently has 15 books, so we can set up an equation: (21 - x) + 42 = <<(21 - x) + 42 = 15>> 15.
5. Simplifying the equation, we have 63 - x = <<63 - x = 15>> 15.
6. To isolate x>>, we subtract 63 from both sides: <<-x = <<x>>, we subtract 63 from both sides: <<-x = 15 - 63>> 15 - 63.
7. Simplifying further, we get -x = <<-x = -48>> -48.
8. Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x>>, we have <<x = <<x>>, we have <<x = 48>> 48.

Therefore, Paul sold 48 more books than he bought.

marco and his dad went strawberry picking . together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds . on the way back marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries . marco 's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds . how much did his dad 's strawberries weigh now ?,"Let's assume the weight of Marco's strawberries is represented by the variable <<M>>, and the weight of his dad's strawberries is represented by the variable <<D>>.

We are given that together, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. This can be expressed as:

M + D = <<M + D = 36>> 36

We are also told that on the way back, Marco's dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries. So, the new weight of Marco's strawberries is 12 pounds. This can be expressed as:

M = <<M = 12>> 12

To find out how much his dad's strawberries weigh now, we need to substitute the value of <<M>> into the first equation:

Now, we can solve for <<D>> by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

D = <<D = 36 - 12>> 36 - 12

Simplifying this expression gives us:

D = <<D = 24>> 24

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries now weigh 24 pounds.

Number of cakes made = 126
Number of pastries made = 48

Number of cakes sold = 115
Number of pastries sold = 81

To find the difference, we subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold:

Difference = Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold

Difference = 115 - 81

Calculating the difference:

Difference = 34

Therefore, Baker made 34 more cakes than pastries.

baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes . if he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries how many more cakes than pastries did baker make ?,"To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made, and then subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made.

Number of pastries made: 52
Number of cakes made: 84

Number of pastries sold: 94
Number of cakes sold: 102

To calculate the difference, we subtract the number sold from the number made for each item:

Difference in pastries = Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold
Difference in cakes = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold

Difference in pastries = 52 - 94
Difference in cakes = 84 - 102

Calculating each difference:

Difference in pastries = -42
Difference in cakes = -18

Since both differences are negative, it means that Baker sold more pastries than he made and also sold more cakes than he made. To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we take the absolute value (ignoring the negative sign) of each difference and compare them:

Absolute value of difference in pastries = |-42| = 42
Absolute value of difference in cakes = |-18| = 18

Therefore, Baker made 18 more cakes than pastries.

paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday . by the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left . how many crayons did he get for his birthday ?,"Let's assume that Paul initially had x crayons for his birthday. 

According to the given information, by the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons and only had 177 left. 

This can be represented as an equation: 
x - 551 = 177

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding 551 to both sides of the equation:
x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551
x = 728

Therefore, Paul received 728 crayons for his birthday.

paul had 51 books and 106 pens . after selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had 82 books and 14 pens left . how many pens did he sell in the garage sale ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books and y pens in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 51 books and 106 pens.
After selling some books and pens, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.

So, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

51 - x = 82   (equation for books)
106 - y = 14   (equation for pens)

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations simultaneously.

Simplifying the first equation:
51 - x = 82
-x = 82 - 51
-x = 31

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:
x = -31

Simplifying the second equation:
106 - y = 14
-y = 14 - 106
-y = -92

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate y:
y = 92

Therefore, Paul sold 31 books and 92 pens in the garage sale.

zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today . david did 39 more push-ups than zachary . john did 9 push-ups less than david . how many more push-ups did zachary do than john ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Zachary did 15 push-ups.
2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.
3. John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.

To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's number of push-ups from Zachary's:

Zachary - John = 15 - 45

Performing the subtraction:

15 - 45 = -30

Therefore, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.

Given:
Required cups of flour = 9
Required cups of sugar = 11
Cups of flour already put in = 4

We can calculate the difference between the required cups of sugar and the required cups of flour as follows:

Required cups of sugar - Required cups of flour = 11 - 9 = 2

This means that Mary needs to add 2 more cups of sugar than cups of flour.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour . she already put in 10 cups of sugar . how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now ?,"To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar Mary needs to add now, we need to subtract the amount of sugar she has already put in from the amount of flour needed.

The recipe calls for 12 cups of sugar and 14 cups of flour. Mary has already put in 10 cups of sugar.

So, the number of cups of flour she needs to add now is equal to the total amount of flour needed minus the amount of sugar she has already put in.

Total amount of flour needed = 14 cups
Amount of sugar already put in = 10 cups

Therefore, the number of more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add now is:

14 - 10 = <<14 - 10 = 4>> 4

Paul initially had 457 erasers and 320 crayons. To find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we can subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons:

320 - 457 = <<320 - 457 = -137>> -137

This means that Paul had 137 fewer crayons than erasers initially.

At the end of the school year, Paul had 523 erasers left. Since he didn't lose any erasers, this is also the number of erasers he initially had. To find out how many more crayons than erasers he had left, we can subtract the number of erasers he had left from the initial difference between crayons and erasers:

-137 - 523 = <<-137 - 523 = -660>> -660

Therefore, Paul had 660 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

Given:
Number of wrappers Danny found at the park = 46
Number of bottle caps Danny found at the park = 50

We also know that Danny currently has:
Number of wrappers in his collection = 52
Number of bottle caps in his collection = 21

To find the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny found at the park, we can subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps:

Number of bottle caps - Number of wrappers

= (Number of bottle caps found at the park + Number of bottle caps in his collection) - (Number of wrappers found at the park + Number of wrappers in his collection)

= (50 + 21) - (46 + 52)

Now let's calculate this expression step by step:

josh lost 11 marbles . if he had 19 marbles in his collection earlier how many marbles does he have now ?,"To find out how many marbles Josh has now, we need to subtract the number of marbles he lost from the number he had earlier.

Let's denote the number of marbles Josh has now as ""x"".

We know that Josh lost 11 marbles, so we can represent this as a subtraction: x - 11.

We also know that he had 19 marbles earlier, so we can set up an equation: x - 11 = 19.

To solve for x, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation: x - 11 + 11 = 19 + 11.

This simplifies to: x = 30.

Therefore, Josh now has 30 marbles.

Let's denote the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as ""x"".

According to the problem, Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds. So, we can write the equation:

x + 13 = <<x + 13 = 35>> 35

To solve for x, we can subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 35 - 13>> 35 - 13

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 22>> 22

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 22 pounds more than Marco's.
