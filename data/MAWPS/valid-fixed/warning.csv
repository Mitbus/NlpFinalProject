According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete is x + 3.

In total, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + (x + 3) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.

To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we add the number of pages of math and reading homework:

2 + (2 + 3) = 2 + 5 = 7

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages in total. Answer: ####"

- The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
- The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the frog and then subtract 26 inches from it.

The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can calculate its distance as $25 + 32 = 57$ inches.

Now, we need to subtract 26 inches from the frog's distance to find out how far the mouse jumped. 

Therefore, the mouse jumped $57 - 26 = 31$ inches.

Initially, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: $7 + x = 11$
This equation represents the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Equation 2: $12 + y = 20$
This equation represents the total number of orchids in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Solving Equation 1 for $x$:
$7 + x = 11$
Subtracting 7 from both sides:
$x = 4$

Solving Equation 2 for $y$:
$12 + y = 20$
Subtracting 12 from both sides:
$y = 8$

Therefore, Jessica cut 4 more roses and 8 more orchids from her flower garden.

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights, which is $M - D$. 

We can substitute the value of $M$ from the first equation into the second equation to solve for $D$.

Now we can substitute the value of $D$ into the expression $M - D$ to find the difference in weights:

$M - D = 30 - (-13)$

Simplifying the expression:

$M - D = 30 + 13$

$M - D = 43$

Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 43 pounds more than his dad's.

We are given that there are 14 bags with an equal number of cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies can be calculated by multiplying the number of bags (14) by the number of cookies in each bag ($x$). This can be expressed as $14x$.

We are also given that there are a total of 28 cookies and 86 candies. Since we only want to find the number of bags of cookies, we can ignore the information about candies for now.

To solve for $x$, we can set up an equation using the information above:

$14x = 28$

To isolate $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 14:

$\frac{14x}{14} = \frac{28}{14}$

Simplifying, we have:

$x = 2$

Therefore, each bag contains 2 cookies.

To find the number of bags of cookies, we divide the total number of cookies (28) by the number of cookies in each bag (2):

$\frac{28}{2} = 14$

So, you have 14 bags of cookies.

1. Steven has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill.
3. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first.

Let's represent the number of peaches Jill has as ""J"". According to the information given, Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, so we can express this as ""S = J + 67"".

Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as ""K"" and express it as ""K = S - 4"".

Now let's substitute the value of S from equation (2) into equation (3):

K = (J + 67) - 4

Simplifying this equation:

K = J + 63

We know that Steven has 12 peaches, so we can substitute S with 12 in equation (2):

12 = J + 67

Subtracting 67 from both sides of the equation:

J = -55

Now we can substitute J with -55 in equation (4) to find out how many peaches Jake has:

K = (-55) + 63

Simplifying this equation:

K = 8

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.

To calculate the difference in length and width, we subtract the width from the length:

Length - Width = 20 - 19

Simplifying this expression:

20 - 19 = 1

Therefore, Jesse's room is 1 foot longer than it is wide.

The razorback shop makes $192 off each t-shirt and $34 off each jersey. 

They sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys during the Arkansas and Texas Tech game.

To calculate the total revenue from t-shirts, we multiply the number of t-shirts sold (157) by the price per t-shirt ($192):

$192 * 157 = $30144

To calculate the total revenue from jerseys, we multiply the number of jerseys sold (19) by the price per jersey ($34):

$34 * 19 = $646

Now, let's find out how much more a t-shirt costs than a jersey by subtracting the revenue from jerseys ($646) from the revenue from t-shirts ($30144):

$30144 - $646 = $29498

Therefore, a t-shirt costs $29498 more than a jersey.

To find the number of aquariums, we can use the formula:

Number of aquariums = Total number of saltwater animals / Number of animals in each aquarium

Substituting the given values, we have:

Number of aquariums = $T / A$

Number of aquariums = $40 / 2$

This equation represents that the total amount earned in 30 days ($30x$) is equal to $420.

Now, we are given that together with the other games, they earned $22. Since we know that the ring toss game made $x$ dollars per day, we can subtract $x$ from $22$ to find out how much the other games made:

1. Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake.
2. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in total.
3. To do that, we can add the number of packs of cookies and the number of packs of cake together.
4. So, we have $2 + 12 = 14$ packs of groceries.
5. However, we also know that Lucy had 56 units of change remaining.
6. This means that the total cost of all the groceries she bought was equal to the amount she initially had plus the change she received back.
7. Let's assume the initial amount Lucy had was X units.
8. Therefore, we can write an equation: X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining) = total cost of groceries.
9. Since we don't know the value of X, we cannot directly calculate the total cost of groceries.
10. However, we can still determine the number of packs of groceries Lucy bought by using the information from step 4.
11. We know that each pack of groceries costs the same amount, so if we divide the total cost by the cost per pack, we will get the number of packs.
12. Let's assume each pack costs Y units.
13. Now we can write another equation: Y (cost per pack) * 14 (total number of packs) = X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining).
14. Simplifying this equation gives us: 14Y = X + 56.
15. Since we don't know the values of X or Y, we cannot directly solve this equation for either variable.
16. However, we can make an assumption about Y to find a solution.
17. Let's assume each pack costs Z units, where Z is a positive integer greater than zero.
18. Now we can rewrite the equation as: 14Z = X + 56.
19. By substituting Z with different positive integers, we can find a solution where X is also a positive integer greater than zero.
20. Let's try Z = 4.
21. Substituting Z = 4 into the equation gives us: 14 * 4 = X + 56.
22. Simplifying this equation gives us: 56 = X + 56.
23. Subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation gives us: X = 0"

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Frank read. Since each book had 249 pages and he finished multiple books, we can multiply the number of pages per book by the number of books he finished. Let's assume he finished ""n"" books.

Total number of pages = 249 * n

Next, we need to determine how many days it took Frank to finish the books. According to the information given, it took him 3 days to finish each book. Since he finished ""n"" books, we can multiply the number of days per book by the number of books he finished.

Total number of days = 3 * n

Let's denote the number of weeks as ""w"".

We are given that Lewis earns $16 each week and a total of $1216 during the harvest. We can set up the following equation:

$16 * w = $1216

To solve for ""w"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by $16:

$\frac{$16 * w}{$16} = \frac{$1216}{$16}$

Simplifying, we have:

1. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height.
2. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron.
3. Ron stands at 13 feet.

To find out how deep the water is, we need to determine Dean's height first.

Since Ron stands at 13 feet and Dean is 4 feet taller, Dean's height can be calculated by adding 4 to Ron's height:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 4
Dean's height = 13 + 4
Dean's height = 17 feet

Now that we know Dean's height, we can calculate the depth of the water by multiplying it by 15:

Depth of water = Dean's height * 15
Depth of water = 17 * 15
Depth of water = 255 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 255 feet.

Given that there were 703 visitors on the previous day and 246 visitors on that specific day, we can calculate the total number of visitors for those two days.

Total visitors = Visitors on previous day + Visitors on specific day
Total visitors = 703 + 246

Now, we can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days (2 in this case).

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days
Average visitors per day = (703 + 246) / 2

Finally, to determine the number of visitors within 25 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by 25.

Number of visitors within 25 days = Average visitors per day * Number of days
Number of visitors within 25 days = ((703 + 246) / 2) * 25

Calculating this expression will give us the final answer."

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail. The mailman has to give 30 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail is $30 \times 78$.

$30 \times 78 = 2340$

Now, let's calculate the total number of houses. We are given that there are 19 houses on a block, and there are 78 blocks in total. So, the total number of houses is $19 \times 78$.

$19 \times 78 = 1482$

Finally, to find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give each house, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses.

$\frac{2340}{1482} = 1.578$

Since we cannot distribute fractional pieces of junk mail, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the mailman should give each house 1 piece of junk mail.

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so its distance is $x + 4$ inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance is $x - 44$ inches.

The total distance covered in the jumping contest is the sum of the distances jumped by each participant. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19$

Simplifying this equation:

$3x - 40 = 19$

Adding 40 to both sides:

$3x = 59$

Dividing both sides by 3:

$x = \frac{59}{3}$

Therefore, the frog jumped approximately $\frac{59}{3}$ inches.

1. Steven has 19 peaches.
2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first.

Since Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, we can express this as an equation: Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches.

Now, let's substitute the information we have:

Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches

We don't know Jill's number of peaches yet, so let's represent it with a variable, say ""x"":

x + 72 = Jake's peaches

Next, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 19 peaches, we can express this as an equation: Steven's peaches - 12 = Jake's peaches.

Substituting the known values:

19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

Now we have two equations for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = Jake's peaches
19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

To solve for x and find Jill's number of peaches, we can equate the two expressions for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = 19 - 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 72 = 7

Subtracting 72 from both sides:

x = -65

Now that we know Jill has -65 peaches (which doesn't make sense in this context), it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the given information. Please double-check the problem statement or provide any additional details if available."

Initially, Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet. After visiting the supermarket and the showroom, she had 26 dollars left. 

We know that Olivia spent 49 dollars at the showroom, so we can subtract this amount from the total she initially had: 

$106 - 49 = 57$

After spending $x$ dollars at the supermarket, Olivia had 26 dollars left, so we can subtract this amount from what she had after visiting the showroom: 

$57 - x = 26$

To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket ($x$), we can solve this equation for $x$:

First, let's calculate Lewis's total earnings during the 1181 weeks of harvest. He earns $491 every week, so we can multiply this amount by the number of weeks:

$491 * 1181 = $579,371

Next, let's calculate Lewis's total rent payments during the 1181 weeks. He pays $216 every week, so we can multiply this amount by the number of weeks:

$216 * 1181 = $255,096

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his total rent payments from his total earnings:

$579,371 - $255,096 = $324,275

Therefore, Lewis will have $324,275 at the end of the harvest season.

If Matthew had 24 crackers and gave x crackers to each friend, he would have 24 - 3x crackers left.

According to the problem, Matthew still had 17 crackers left after giving some to his friends. So we can set up the equation:

24 - 3x = 17

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

24 - 3x - 17 = 17 - 17
7 - 3x = 0

Next, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 7 from both sides:

7 - 7 - 3x = 0 - 7
-3x = -7

To solve for x, we divide both sides by -3:

(-3x) / (-3) = (-7) / (-3)
x = 7/3

Since we are looking for a whole number of crackers, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 2 crackers.
