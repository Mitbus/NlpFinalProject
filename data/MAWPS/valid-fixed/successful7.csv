there are 8 different books and 10 different movies in the ' crazy silly school ' series . if you read 19 of the books and watched 61 of the movies how many more movies than books are there in the ' crazy silly school ' series ?,"To find out how many more movies than books there are in the 'Crazy Silly School' series, we need to subtract the number of books from the number of movies.

Given:
Number of books = 8
Number of movies = 10
Books read = 19
Movies watched = 61

To find the difference, we subtract the number of books read from the total number of books and the number of movies watched from the total number of movies.

Number of remaining books = Total number of books - Books read
Number of remaining movies = Total number of movies - Movies watched

Number of remaining books = 8 - 19
Number of remaining movies = 10 - 61

Calculating:
Number of remaining books = -11
Number of remaining movies = -51

Since we cannot have negative numbers for the remaining books and movies, it means that there are no more books or movies left in the 'Crazy Silly School' series. Therefore, there are no more movies than books in the series.

marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 10 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds . how much more did his dad 's strawberries weigh than his ?,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as <<M>> and the weight of his dad's strawberries as <<D>>. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, so we can write:

M = <<M = 10>> 10

We are also given that together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds, so we can write:

M + D = <<M + D = 26>> 26

To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weigh than Marco's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights. We can subtract Marco's weight from the total weight to find this:

D = <<D = (M + D) - M>> (M + D) - M

Substituting the values we know:

D = <<D = 26 - 10>> 26 - 10

Calculating the subtraction:

D = <<D = 16>> 16

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weigh 16 pounds more than Marco's.

23 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop 24 children got on the bus while some got off the bus . then there were 8 children altogether on the bus . how many more children got off the bus than those that got on ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus.
Then, 24 children got on the bus at the bus stop.
After that, some children got off the bus.
Finally, there were 8 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to calculate the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on.

Let's represent the number of children who got off as ""x"".

The number of children who got on can be calculated by adding the initial number of children (23) and those who got on at the bus stop (24). So, it is 23 + 24 = 47.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

47 - x = 8

To solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 47 from both sides:

47 - x - 47 = 8 - 47
-x = -39

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-39)
x = 39

Therefore, 39 more children got off the bus than those that got on.

winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries . 86 bird families flew away for the winter from near a mountain . if there were 45 bird families living near the mountain initially how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind ?,"To find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the total number of bird families that flew away.

The total number of bird families that flew away is given as 86.

The number of bird families that stayed behind is given as 45.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the total number of bird families that flew away:

86 - 45 = <<86 - 45 = 41>> 41

Therefore, 41 more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind.

a waiter had 11 customers . after some left he still had 3 customers . how many more customers left than those that stayed behind ?,"Let's denote the number of customers who left as ""x"". 

Initially, the waiter had 11 customers. After some left, he still had 3 customers. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

11 - x = 3

To find out how many more customers left than those that stayed behind, we need to solve for ""x"". 

First, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 

11 - x - 3 = 3 - 3
8 - x = 0

Next, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 

8 - x - 8 = 0 - 8
-x = -8

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: 

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-8)
x = 8

Therefore, 8 more customers left than those that stayed behind.

marco and his dad went strawberry picking . together they collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds . on the way back marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries . marco 's strawberries now weighed 3 pounds . how much did his dad 's strawberries weigh ?,"Let's assume the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as ""x"" pounds.

According to the given information, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds. Since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, his strawberries now weigh 3 pounds. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
Marco's strawberries + Marco's dad's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries
3 + x = 24

To find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries, we need to solve for ""x"" in the equation.

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
x = 24 - 3

Simplifying the right side:
x = 21

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 21 pounds.

a farmer had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden . if he picked 53 tomatoes how many tomatoes and potatoes does he have left ?,"The farmer initially had 177 tomatoes and 12 potatoes in his garden. If he picked 53 tomatoes, we need to subtract this number from the initial amount of tomatoes to find out how many are left. 

177 - 53 = 124

Therefore, the farmer has 124 tomatoes left. 

Since the problem only asks for the number of tomatoes and potatoes left, we don't need to consider the potatoes at this point. 

So, the farmer has 124 tomatoes left.

paul got a box of 531 crayons and 38 erasers for his birthday . at the end of the school year he only had 391 left while not having lost a single erasers . how many more crayons than erasers did he have left ?,"To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of erasers from the number of crayons he had at the beginning and compare it to the number of crayons he had left at the end.

Paul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. We can represent this as an equation: 531 - 38 = <<531 - 38 = X>> X, where X represents the number of crayons Paul had left at the end.

Simplifying the equation, we have 493 = <<493 = X>> X.

To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we subtract the number of erasers (38) from the number of crayons left (X): X - 38 = <<X - 38 = Y>> Y, where Y represents the difference between the number of crayons and erasers.

Substituting X with 493 in the equation, we have 493 - 38 = <<493 - 38 = Y>> Y.

Simplifying the equation, we get 455 = <<455 = Y>> Y.

Therefore, Paul had 455 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

jack received 6 emails in the morning 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening . if he received a total of 10 emails in the day how many emails did jack receive in the afternoon ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Jack received 6 emails in the morning.
2. Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.
3. Let's assume Jack received x emails in the evening.

To find out how many emails Jack received in the afternoon, we need to determine the value of x that satisfies the condition ""he received a total of 10 emails in the day.""

The total number of emails Jack received is given by the sum of the emails he received in the morning, afternoon, and evening:

6 + 3 + x = 10

To isolate x, we can subtract 6 and 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = 10 - 6 - 3

Simplifying further:

x = 1

Therefore, Jack received 1 email in the evening.

So, Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour . she already put in some cups of flour . if she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar how many cups of flour did she put in ?,"Let's assume the number of cups of flour Mary put in is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the problem, Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, Mary needs 3 + 5 = <<3 + 5 = 8>> 8 cups of flour.

We also know that Mary already put in some cups of flour, which is represented by <<x>>. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = <<x + 5 = 8>> 8

To solve for <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = <<x = 8 - 5>> 8 - 5

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, Mary put in 3 cups of flour.

a waiter had 3 customers . after some left he still had 4 customers . how many more customers stayed behind than those that left ?,"Let's denote the number of customers who left as ""x"". 

Initially, the waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. 

So, the equation representing this situation can be written as:

3 - x = 4

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to solve for ""x"".

Adding ""x"" to both sides of the equation:

3 - x + x = 4 + x

Simplifying:

3 = 4 + x

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

3 - 4 = 4 + x - 4

Simplifying:

-1 = x

Therefore, there was 1 more customer who stayed behind than those that left.

- Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
- At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus.
- After some more children got on the bus, there were 12 children altogether.

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to determine the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on.

The number of children who got off is given as 68. To find the number of children who got on, we can subtract the final count (12) from the initial count (36):

36 - 12 = <<36 - 12 = 24>> 24

Therefore, 24 children got on the bus.

Now we can calculate how many more children got off than those that got on by subtracting the number of children who got on from the number of children who got off:

68 - 24 = <<68 - 24 = 44>> 44

So, 44 more children got off the bus than those that got on.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 39 inches . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?,"Let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as <<x>> inches. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so its distance is <<x + 19>> inches. 

The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance is <<x - 12>> inches. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped a total of 39 inches, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 19 + x - 12 = <<x + 19 + x - 12 = 39>> 39

Simplifying this equation: 

2x + 7 = <<2x + 7 = 39>> 39

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 

2x = <<2x = 32>> 32

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = <<x = 16>> 16

Therefore, the frog jumped 16 inches and the mouse jumped 16 - 12 = <<16 - 12 = 4>> 4 inches.

2. At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus.
3. Let's assume that x children got off the bus.
4. After some children got off, there were 30 children altogether on the bus.
5. So, we can write the equation: 28 + 82 - x = 30.

To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to solve for x.

6. Simplifying the equation: 110 - x = 30.
7. Subtracting 110 from both sides of the equation: -x = -80.
8. Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 to isolate x: x = 80.

Therefore, 80 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

Finally, we can find the total number of nails needed by adding the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks together:

 180 + 50 = << 180 + 50 = 230 >> 230 

Therefore, John needs a total of 230 nails for the house wall.

jerry had 7 books and 3 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf . how many more books than action figures were on his shelf ?,"Jerry initially had 7 books and 3 action figures on the shelf. He then added 2 more action figures to the shelf. To find out how many more books than action figures were on his shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the number of books.

Number of books: 7
Number of action figures: 3
Number of additional action figures: 2

To calculate the difference, we subtract the number of action figures from the number of books:

7 - 3 = <<7 - 3 = 4>> 4

Therefore, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.

6 birds were sitting on the fence . 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them . how many birds are sitting on the fence ?,"Initially, there were 6 birds sitting on the fence. Then, an additional 4 birds and 8 storks came to join them. To find out how many birds are now sitting on the fence, we need to add the number of birds that joined to the initial number of birds.

The number of birds that joined is 4 + 8 = 12.

To find the total number of birds sitting on the fence, we add this number to the initial number of birds: 6 + 12 = 18.

Therefore, there are currently 18 birds sitting on the fence.

rachel 's tree had 2 apples . she picked 4 apples from her tree . thereafter 3 new apples grew on the tree . how many apples are there on the tree now ?,"Rachel initially had 2 apples on her tree. She then picked 4 apples from the tree. After that, 3 new apples grew on the tree. To find out how many apples are there on the tree now, we can add the number of apples Rachel initially had, the number of apples she picked, and the number of new apples that grew on the tree.

Number of apples Rachel initially had: 2
Number of apples she picked: 4
Number of new apples that grew on the tree: 3

To find the total number of apples on the tree now, we can add these three numbers together:

2 + 4 + 3 = 9

Therefore, there are currently 9 apples on Rachel's tree.

nell collects cards . she had 438 baseball cards and 18 10 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 55 10 cards and 178 baseball cards left . how many more baseball cards than 10 cards does nell have ?,"To find out how many more baseball cards than 10 cards Nell has, we need to calculate the difference between the number of baseball cards and the number of 10 cards she has.

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 10 cards. After giving some cards to Jeff, she now has 55 10 cards and 178 baseball cards left.

To calculate the difference, we subtract the number of 10 cards from the number of baseball cards:

438 - 55 = 383

So, Nell has 383 more baseball cards than 10 cards.

winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries . there are 19 bird families living near the mountain . if 60 bird families flew away for winter how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind ?,"To find out how many more bird families flew away for the winter than those that stayed behind, we need to subtract the number of bird families that stayed behind from the total number of bird families that flew away.

Given:
Number of bird families living near the mountain = 19
Number of bird families that flew away for winter = 60

To find the number of bird families that stayed behind, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families:

Number of bird families that stayed behind = Total number of bird families - Number of bird families that flew away
Number of bird families that stayed behind = 19 - 60

Now let's calculate:

Number of bird families that stayed behind = -41

Since we cannot have a negative number of bird families, it means that all the bird families near the mountain flew away for winter. Therefore, there were no bird families left behind.

So, the answer is:

you had 26 bags with equal number of cookies . if you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total how many bags of cookies do you have ?,"Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

We are given that there are 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, so we can write the equation:

26x = <<26x = 52>> 52

To find the value of <<x>>, we divide both sides of the equation by 26:

2 / 6x}{26} = <<2 / 6x}{26} = 5 / 2{26}>> 5 / 2{26}

Simplifying, we have:

x = <<x = 2>> 2

Therefore, each bag contains 2 cookies. 

Now, let's calculate how many bags of cookies we have in total. We know that there are 15 candies and a total of 52 cookies. Since each bag contains 2 cookies, we can find the number of bags by dividing the total number of cookies by the number of cookies in each bag:

5 / 2{2} = <<5 / 2{2} = 26>> 26

So, we have 26 bags of cookies.
