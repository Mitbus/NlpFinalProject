The problem states that Janine needs to make 750 mini meat pies for the mayor's party. 

The first team made $ 235 $ pies and the second team made $ 275 $ pies.

Since Janine needs a total of 750 pies and the first two teams made a total of $ 235 + 275 = 510 $ pies, the third team needs to make:

$ 750 - 510 = 240 $ pies.

next food item she has to prepare is soup . she needs number0 cups of mushroom soup . if the first team made number1 cups and the third team made number2 cups how any cups should the second team prepare in order to meet the required amount of soup ?,"[280,90,70]","[-,number0,+,number1,number2]",120,"[1,4,11,12,13,46,47,48,21,22,23,24,29,30,31]",next food item she has to prepare is soup . she needs number0 cups of mushroom soup . if the first team made number1 cups and the third team made number2 cups,how any cups should the second team prepare in order to meet the required amount of soup ?,,[],2195,"  #### 140

The problem states that the total amount of soup needed is 280 cups. The first team made 90 cups and the third team made 70 cups. Therefore, the amount of soup the second team needs to make can be calculated as:

$280 - (90 + 70) =$

$280 - 160 =$

$120$ cups

However, the problem asks how many *more* cups the second team needs to make compared to the other teams. Since the first team made 90 cups and the third team made 70 cups, we add those amounts:

$90 + 70 =$

$160$ cups 

Subtracting 160 cups from the total needed (280 cups) gives the amount the second team still needs to make:

$280 - 160 =$

$140$ cups

Therefore, the second team needs to make $140$ cups of mushroom soup in order to meet the required amount."

I'd be happy to help you with this math problem. Let's break it down step by step.

We know that the first team made 189 pieces and the second team made 131 pieces. To find out how many pieces the third team should make, we need to subtract the combined pieces made by the first and second teams from the target of 500 pieces.

So, let's start by adding the pieces made by the first and second teams: $189 + 131 = 320$.

Now, we can find out how many pieces the third team should make by subtracting the total pieces made by the first and second teams from the target of 500 pieces: $500 - 320 = 180$.

Therefore, the third team should make 180 pieces.

The question states that he bought 215 lbs of cement and his son brought 137 lbs of cement. In total, they now have 450 lbs of cement. We need to find how much cement he originally had.

$ 215 + 137 = 352 $

He bought 215 lbs and his son brought 137 lbs, so together they brought 352 lbs of cement. 

$ 450 - 352 = 98 $

They now have 450 lbs of cement and they brought 352 lbs, so the difference is 450 - 352 = 98 lbs.

So the amount of cement he originally had is 98 lbs.

#### $261*23= 5,983$

There are several ways that AI models can be trained to solve math problems. One approach is to train a language model to generate solutions directly in natural language, as demonstrated by OpenAI's AI Math Teacher. However, language models often struggle with multistep reasoning and making subtle logical mistakes.

Another approach is to generate code that outputs the solution, as explored by researchers at MIT. They found that simply prompting OpenAI's Codex model with ""write a program"" followed by the problem text was enough to produce correct Python code for around 70% of university-level math problems.

For the given problem, the steps would be:

1. There are $261$ fishbowls 
2. Each fishbowl has $23$ fish
3. To find the total number of fish, multiply the number of fishbowls by the number of fish in each bowl:

$261 * 23 = 5,983$

Generating code to output the solution is helpful because the program can be run multiple times to check for errors. The code can also produce other useful outputs like graphs and plots.

While AI systems are getting better at solving math problems, they still make logical mistakes and require techniques like verification and few-shot learning to reach human-level performance. Progress is also being made on generating new math problems, though human evaluators still find human-created problems to be slightly better suited for educational use.

In summary, by framing math problems as programs that output solutions, AI systems are able to leverage large pre-trained code models to achieve high accuracy on university-level problems. With continued improvements, these techniques show promise for assisting with mathematics education.

Hope this breakdown of the problem and solution helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

$ Mr. Lee wants to load 134 tons of fruits.  

$ A large truck can load 15 tons of fruits and a small truck can load 7 tons.

$ We need to use the least number of trucks and have every truck fully occupied.

$ Since a large truck can load 15 tons and Mr. Lee needs to load 134 tons, we divide 134 by 15 to find the number of large trucks needed:   

$ 134 ÷ 15 = 8.93 (round up to 9 trucks)

$ 9 large trucks can load 9 × 15 = 135 tons, which is enough to load all 134 tons of fruit.

$ Therefore, the least number of large trucks needed is 9 trucks.

The tourist group has 26 people. They want to rent large rooms for 3 people each and small rooms for 2 people each. We need to rent the least number of rooms while ensuring all rooms are fully occupied.

First, we can fill the large rooms that accommodate 3 people. Each large room can hold 3 people, so we can fill $8$ large rooms with $3 \times 8 = 24$ people.

This leaves $26 - 24 = 2$ people who need a room. We can put these 2 people in 1 small room that holds 2 people.

Therefore, the total number of rooms needed is:

$8$ large rooms  
$1$ small room

So the minimum number of large rooms that need to be rented is $8$ large rooms.

The worm starts at 26 inches deep in the hole.
Every day, it climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches.  
So on the first day, it climbs up 8 inches to 18 inches deep.   
Then it slides back 3 inches to 21 inches deep.    
On the second day, it again climbs up 8 inches to 13 inches deep.  
Then it slides back 3 inches to 16 inches deep.
We need to find how many days it takes for the worm to reach the surface at 0 inches deep.
Let's call the number of days $n$.   
The pattern is:    
The worm climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches every day.
So on day $n$, the worm will climb $8n$ inches total and slide back $3n$ inches.
Since it needs to reach 0 inches deep, we can set up an equation:
$26 - (8n - 3n) = 0$
Solving for $n$:
$26 - 5n = 0$
$5n = 26$
$n = 26/5$
$n = 5$ days

We know that Maura found 75 seashells initially and gave some to her sister. After giving some to her sister, she had 57 seashells left. 

So, we can write the equation: 75 - x = 57.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation.

Starting with 75, subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us: 75 - x - x = 57 - x.

Simplifying the equation gives us: 75 - 2x = 57.

To isolate the variable, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation: 75 - 2x - 75 = 57 - 75.

Simplifying the equation gives us: -2x = -18.

Finally, to solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2x) / -2 = (-18) / -2.

Simplifying the equation gives us: x = 9.

Therefore, Maura gave 9 seashells to her sister.

To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of chimps.

Total bananas per day = 72
Number of chimps = 45

So, bananas per chimp per day = Total bananas per day / Number of chimps

Bananas per chimp per day = 72 / 45 = 1.6 bananas

Next, let's find out how many bananas the 18 chimps that are being moved eat per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas per chimp per day by the number of chimps being moved.

Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas
Number of chimps being moved = 18

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = Bananas per chimp per day * Number of chimps being moved

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 1.6 * 18 = 28.8 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas the remaining chimps in the old cage eat per day. We can do this by subtracting the bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day from the total bananas per day.

Total bananas per day = 72 bananas
Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 28.8 bananas

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = Total bananas per day - Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 72 - 28.8 = 43.2 bananas

Since each chimp eats 1.6 bananas per day, we can find out how many chimps will stay in the old cage by dividing the bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day by the number of bananas per chimp per day.

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 43.2 bananas
Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day / Bananas per chimp per day

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = 43.2 / 1.6 = 27

Therefore, 27 chimps will stay in the old cage.####

Anthony had 8 cents left after buying the cupcake. We can represent this as $48 - c = 8$. 

To find the cost of the cupcake, we can solve the equation $48 - c = 8$ for $c$. 

Subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation, we have $48 - 48 - c = 8 - 48$. Simplifying, we get $-c = -40$.

1. $x + y = 90$ (equation 1)
2. $x + y = 25$ (equation 2)

To find the number of comic books Scott and Sam sold, we need to solve these equations.

Let A represent the number of miles Adam ran, and K represent the number of miles Katie ran.

We know from the problem that:
1. Adam ran 25 miles more than Katie: A = K + 25
2. Adam ran 35 miles: A = 35

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the first equation:

35 = K + 25

To solve for K, we need to isolate K on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 25 from both sides:

K = 35 - 25

K = 10

So, Katie ran 10 miles.

2. 2 of these games were at night.
3. The team won most of their games.

To find out how many games the team won, we can start by calculating the total number of games they lost and the games they won.

Total Games = 18 (the number of games played)
Games at Night = 2
Games Lost = 3

To find the number of games won, we can use the fact that the team won most of their games, which implies they won more games than they lost. Since there were 18 games in total, and we know they lost 3 games and 2 games were at night, we can calculate the number of games won as follows:

Total Games - (Games Lost + Games at Night) = Games Won
18 - (3 + 2) = Games Won
18 - 5 = Games Won

Now, let's calculate the number of games won:

$18 - 5 = 13$

So, the team won 13 games.

1. Calculate the price of 1 game.
2. Calculate how much they would have made from selling 26 games.

Let's start with step 1:

1. The store is selling 3 games for $34, so the price of 1 game is: $34 / 3 = $11.33 (rounded to two decimal places).

Now, let's move on to step 2:

2. To find out how much they would have made from selling 26 games, we can simply multiply the price of 1 game by the number of games sold:

   $11.33 (price of 1 game) * 26 (number of games sold) = $294.58

So, if the video game store sold 26 games at the rate of 3 for $34, they would have made approximately $294.58.

Let's call the number of cookies eaten ""x.""

The total number of cookies in the package was 18, and after eating some, there were 9 left. So, we can express this as an equation:

18 (initial total) - x (cookies eaten) = 9 (leftover cookies)

Now, let's solve for x:

18 - x = 9

To isolate x, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

- x = 9 - 18

Now, calculate the right side of the equation:

- x = -9

To find the number of cookies eaten, we need to make the value of x positive. Since it represents cookies eaten, we can take the absolute value of -9 to get the number of cookies eaten:

|-9| = 9

So, 9 cookies were eaten.

Ned originally had some video games, and he gave away 13 of them to a friend. After giving away those games, he now has 6 games left.

To find out how many games Ned originally had, we can set up an equation:

Original number of games - 13 (games given away) = 6 (games left)

We need to solve for the ""Original number of games.""

Original number of games - 13 = 6

Now, to isolate the ""Original number of games"" on one side of the equation, we can add 13 to both sides:

Let's use the symbol $ to denote Dave's initial number of tickets. The equation becomes:

For the first 9 days: $2 \times 9 = 18$

On the final day: $2 + 4 = 6$

To find the total amount used all together, we add the amounts from both parts:

$18 + 6 = 24$

So, the florist will use 24 pounds of fertilizer all together.

To find out how much money he actually earned, we need to calculate the amount he earned for the lawns he did mow and then subtract the amount he would have earned for the lawns he forgot to mow.

Step 1: Calculate the amount earned for the lawns he did mow.
Number of lawns mowed = 12 - 8 (lawns he forgot to mow) = 4 lawns mowed
Amount earned for the lawns mowed = 4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned.
Amount earned = 4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn - amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow

Step 3: Calculate the amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow.
Amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns = 8 lawns * $9 per lawn

Now, let's calculate the actual amount he earned.

Amount earned = (4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn) - (8 lawns * $9 per lawn)

Amount earned = ($36) - ($72)

Amount earned = $36 - $72
