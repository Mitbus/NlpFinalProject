1. Tim got 3 nickels. Each nickel is worth 5 cents, so the value of the nickels is:
   $3 \times 5 = 15$ cents.

2. Tim also got 13 dimes. Each dime is worth 10 cents, so the value of the dimes is:
   $13 \times 10 = 130$ cents.

3. In his tip jar, Tim found 7 dimes, which is worth:
   $7 \times 10 = 70$ cents.

4. Tim also found 9 half-dollars. Each half-dollar is worth 50 cents, so the value of the half-dollars is:
   $9 \times 50 = 450$ cents.

Now, let's add up all the values to find out how much money Tim got in total:

$15$ cents (nickels) + $130$ cents (dimes) + $70$ cents (tip jar dimes) + $450$ cents (half-dollars) = $665$ cents.

Number of students at the start of the year = 10
Number of students who left during the year = 4
Number of new students who came to the school = 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can subtract the number of students who left from the number of students at the start of the year and then add the number of new students who came to the school.

Number of students at the end of the year = (Number of students at the start of the year - Number of students who left) + Number of new students who came to the school

Number of students at the end of the year = (10 - 4) + 42

Calculating the expression inside the parentheses first:
Number of students at the end of the year = 6 + 42

Adding the two numbers together:
Number of students at the end of the year = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

We can do this by finding the cost of the chocolate and carob separately and then adding them together. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Cost of 2 pounds of chocolate:
   The cost of 1 pound of chocolate is $2, so the cost of 2 pounds of chocolate is $2 * 2 = $4.

2. Cost of 55 pounds of carob candy:
   The cost of 1 pound of carob candy is $7, so the cost of 55 pounds of carob candy is $7 * 55 = $385.

3. Total cost of the mixture:
   The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of chocolate and carob candy, so it is $4 + $385 = $389.

4. Total weight of the mixture:
   The total weight of the mixture is the sum of the weight of chocolate and carob candy, so it is 2 pounds + 55 pounds = 57 pounds.

5. Cost per pound of the mixture:
   To find the cost per pound of the mixture, we divide the total cost by the total weight, so it is $389 / 57 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the cost per pound of the mixture:

$389 / 57 pounds = $6.82 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the cost per pound of the mixture is $6.82.

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. To find the total number of tickets he has:

Total tickets = 2 (from 'whack a mole') + 13 (from 'skee ball') = 15 tickets.

Now, we need to find out how many candies Luke can buy. Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can use division to calculate the number of candies:

Number of candies = Total tickets / Cost per candy = 15 tickets / 3 tickets per candy = 5 candies.

So, Luke can buy 5 candies.

1. The total weight of the box of books is 42 pounds.
2. Each book weighs 3 pounds.

Let's represent the number of books as ""$B$.""

The total weight of the books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the weight of each book:

$B \times 3$ pounds

According to the problem, the total weight of the box of books is 42 pounds. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

$B \times 3 = 42$

To solve for $B$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

$\frac{B \times 3}{3} = \frac{42}{3}$

Simplifying:

$B = 14$

So, there are 14 books in the box.

If the pet store had $88$ puppies and sold $34$ of them, that means $88 - 34 = 54$ puppies remained. 

To figure out how many cages they used, we need to know how many puppies fit in each cage. The problem states that $6$ puppies fit in each cage.

Since $54$ puppies remained and $6$ fit in each cage, we can divide $54$ puppies by $6$ puppies per cage to find the number of cages needed:

$54 \div 6 = 9$

But the problem asks for the number of cages used, not remaining. Since $34$ puppies were sold, those puppies also needed cages. So we add the number of cages for the puppies sold:

$9 + (\frac{34}{6}) = 9 + 6 = $  $\boxed{8}$ cages"

Let's solve the math problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. Since Paula bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each, we can multiply the cost of one shirt by the number of shirts: $11 * 2 = 22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants. The pair of pants costs $13.

To find out how much money Paula spent in total, we need to add the cost of the shirts and pants together. So, $22 + $13 = 35.

Now, we can determine how much money Paula has left. Since she initially had $109, we can subtract the total cost of her purchases: $109 - $35 = 74.

So, Paula has $74 left to buy more clothes.

11 (points Paige scored) + 6 (points each for the other players) * (P - 1) (since Paige is one of the players) = 41 (total points).

Now, we can solve for P:

11 + 6(P - 1) = 41

First, we can distribute 6 to both terms inside the parentheses:

11 + 6P - 6 = 41

Next, let's isolate the term with P:

6P = 41 - 11 + 6

Now, perform the arithmetic:

Finally, divide both sides by 6 to find the number of players (P):

P = 36 / 6

P = 6

So, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

\[ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\% \]

In this case, the ""Old Value"" is the number of voters in the first year (76 million), and the ""New Value"" is the number of voters in the next year (7 million).

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the change in the number of voters:
   \[ \text{Change in Voters} = \text{New Value} - \text{Old Value} = 7\,000\,000 - 76\,000\,000 \]

2. Calculate the percentage change:
   \[ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{Change in Voters}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\% \]

Now, let's calculate it:

Change in Voters: $ 7\,000\,000 - 76\,000\,000 = -69\,000\,000 $

Percentage Change: $ \frac{-69\,000\,000}{76\,000\,000} \times 100\% = -90.789474\% $

So, the percentage change in the number of voters is approximately -90.789474%.

Speed is typically measured in meters per second (m/s). 

The formula for speed is:

$$ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{\text{Distance (m)}}{\text{Time (s)}} $$

In this case, you walked 500 meters in 6 minutes, which is equivalent to 6 * 60 seconds since there are 60 seconds in a minute.

So, the speed can be calculated as:

$$ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{500 \, \text{m}}{6 \times 60 \, \text{s}} $$

Now, let's calculate it:

$$ \text{Speed (m/s)} = \frac{500 \, \text{m}}{360 \, \text{s}} = \frac{5}{36} \, \text{m/s} $$

So, you were traveling at a speed of 5/36 m/s.

Now, we can convert cents to dollars. There are 100 cents in 1 dollar, so we divide the total amount in cents by 100 to get the amount in dollars:

$\frac{300}{100}$ = $3$ dollars.

So, Mrs. Hilt paid $3 dollars for all of the hot dogs.

charlie has number0 more snowballs than lucy . she has number1 snowballs . how many does charlie have ?,"[31,19]","[+,number0,number1]",50,"[1,2,3,4,9,10,11,15,16,17]",charlie has number0 more snowballs than lucy . she has number1 snowballs .,how many does charlie have ?,,[],2062,"Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. We are given that Charlie has 31 more snowballs than Lucy.
2. We are also given that Charlie has 19 snowballs.

To find out how many snowballs Lucy has, we can subtract 31 from the number of snowballs Charlie has:

$19 - 31 = -12$

So, Lucy has -12 snowballs, which doesn't make sense in a real-world context, but it's what the problem indicates.

Now, to find out how many snowballs Charlie has, we can add 31 to what Lucy has (which is -12 in this case):

$-12 + 31 = 19$

So, Charlie has 19 snowballs.

Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as $F$ and the number of people at the second concert as $S$. We know that the total number of people who attended both concerts is 65,899.

So, we can write the equation:
$F + S = 65,899$

We also know that the second concert had 119 more people in attendance than the first concert, so we can write another equation:
$S = F + 119$

Now we can use these two equations to solve for the number of people at the second concert. First, we'll substitute the second equation into the first one:

$F + (F + 119) = 65,899$

Now, we can combine the terms:

$2F + 119 = 65,899$

Subtract 119 from both sides to isolate 2F:

$2F = 65,899 - 119$

$2F = 65,780$

Now, divide by 2 to find the number of people at the first concert, F:

$F = \frac{65,780}{2}$

Now, calculate F:

$F = 32,890$

So, there were 32,890 people at the first concert. To find the number of people at the second concert, use the second equation:

$S = F + 119$

$S = 32,890 + 119$

$S = 33,009$

So, there were 33,009 people at the second concert.

mrs. hilt is baking bread . she needs number0 cups of flour to bake number1 loaves of bread . how much flour will she need to make number2 loaf of bread ?,"[5,2,1]","[/,number0,number1]","2,5","[1,7,8,9,13,14,15,26,27,28,29,30]",mrs. hilt is baking bread . she needs number0 cups of flour to bake number1 loaves of bread .,how much flour will she need to make number2 loaf of bread ?,,[],2416,"To find out how much flour Mrs. Hilt needs to make 1 loaf of bread, we can set up a proportion:

$\frac{5 \text{ cups of flour}}{2 \text{ loaves of bread}} = \frac{x \text{ cups of flour}}{1 \text{ loaf of bread}}$

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:

$5 \cdot 1 = 2x$

$5 = 2x$

To solve for $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$x = \frac{5}{2}$

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

$x = 2.5$

So, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make 1 loaf of bread.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Number of fleas in Harry Hound's right ear: 36
2. Number of fleas in his left ear: 85
3. Total number of fleas initially found in both ears: 36 (right ear) + 85 (left ear)

Now, we can calculate how many fleas perished:

Total fleas initially found - (Fleas in the right ear + Fleas in the left ear)

So,

36 + 85 = 121

Initial number of fleas - 121 (total in both ears) = Perished fleas

Now, let's calculate the number of perished fleas:

Initial number of fleas - 121 = Perished fleas

1. Blithe initially had a certain number of toys.
2. He lost 6 toys, which means he had 6 less toys than before.
3. Then he found 9 toys in his closet, which means he had 9 more toys than after losing some.

So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Initial number of toys - 6 (lost) + 9 (found) = 43

Now, we can solve for the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys - 6 + 9 = 43

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

Initial number of toys + 9 = 43 + 6

Initial number of toys + 9 = 49

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to find the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys = 49 - 9

Initial number of toys = 40

So, Blithe initially had 40 toys.

After 7 more passengers got on the bus, the total number of passengers increased by 7 to become ""x + 7"".

Then, 9 passengers got off the bus, which means the total number of passengers decreased by 9 to become ""(x + 7) - 9"".

Finally, we know that in the end there are 26 passengers on the bus, so we can set up the equation:

""(x + 7) - 9 = 26""

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

(x + 7) - 9 = 26
x + 7 - 9 = 26
x - 2 = 26
x = 26 + 2
x = 28

Therefore, there were 28 passengers on the bus initially.

According to the problem, Bruno lost 4 books, so the number of books he had after losing 4 is ""x - 4"". 

After losing 4 books, Bruno's dad gave him 10 more books, so the total number of books he had after his dad gave him the books is ""x - 4 + 10"".

We are given that Bruno had 39 books after his dad gave him the books, so we can set up the equation:

x - 4 + 10 = 39

Simplifying the equation:

x + 6 = 39

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

x = 33

Therefore, Bruno had 33 books at first.

To find the number of children, we can subtract the number of men and women from the total passengers:

Children = Total passengers - Men - Women
Children = 54 - 18 - 26

Calculating this expression:

Children = 54 - 18 - 26
Children = 54 - (18 + 26)

We know that the total number of campers is equal to the sum of soccer campers, basketball campers, and football campers. In this case, the total number of campers is 88.

So we can write the equation:
x + 24 + 32 = 88

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 and 32 from both sides:

x + 24 + 32 - 24 - 32 = 88 - 24 - 32

Simplifying the equation:
x + 56 = 56

Now, to isolate x, we need to subtract 56 from both sides:

x + 56 - 56 = 56 - 56

Simplifying the equation further:
x = 0

So, there were 0 soccer campers.

For every 6 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.

$$
\frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ point}} = \frac{28 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ points}}
$$

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

$$
6 \cdot x = 28 \cdot 1
$$

$$
6x = 28
$$

To isolate x (the number of points), divide both sides of the equation by 6:

$$
x = \frac{28}{6}
$$

Now, simplify the fraction:

$$
x = 4\frac{2}{6}
$$

To express this as a whole number with a remainder, we can divide 4 by 6:

$$
4 \div 6 = 0 with a remainder of 4
$$

So, the answer is that Chloe and her friends earned 4 points with 2 pounds of paper recycling.

First, let's calculate how much Victor spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck costs 8 dollars and Victor bought 6 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks: $ 8 \times 6 = 48 $.

Next, let's calculate how much Victor's friend spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck also costs 8 dollars and his friend bought 2 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks: $ 8 \times 2 = 16 $.

Now, let's add the amounts spent by Victor and his friend to find the total amount spent: $ 48 + 16 = 64 $.

Therefore, they spent a total of 64 dollars on the trick decks.

Faye scored 28 points, and everyone else scored 8 points each. So, the total number of points scored can be represented as:

$28 + 8P$

We know that the total points scored by the team are 68. So, we can set up the equation:

$28 + 8P = 68$

Now, let's solve for $P$:

Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the term with $P$:

$8P = 68 - 28$

$8P = 40$

To find the number of players on Faye's team ($P$), we need to divide both sides by 8:

$P = \frac{40}{8}$

Now, calculate the value of $P$:

$P = 5$

So, there were 5 players on Faye's team.
