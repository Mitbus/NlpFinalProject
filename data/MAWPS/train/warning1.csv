Simple Interest ($SI$) = Principal ($P$) × Rate ($R$) × Time ($T$)

Where:
- $P$ is the principal amount (initial deposit),
- $R$ is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- $T$ is the time in years.

In this case:
- $P$ = $70$ dollars
- $R$ = $3\%$, which is equivalent to $0.03$ in decimal form
- $T$ = $2$ years

Now, plug these values into the formula:

$SI$ = $70$ × $0.03$ × $2$

Now, calculate each part of the formula:

15 - 8 = 7

So, the chef still needs to cook 7 potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes still needed by the cooking time for each potato to find out how long it will take to cook the rest. 

Number of potatoes still needed * Cooking time per potato = Total cooking time for the rest

7 * 9 = 63

Therefore, it will take the chef 63 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Let's denote the selling price as $S$.

The dealer's profit should be 25% of the selling price, which means:

Profit = 25% of $S$

25% can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100, so:

Profit = 0.25 * $S$

Now, to find the selling price that includes this profit, we need to add the profit to the cost price:

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
$S = $6000 + (0.25 * $S)$

1. First, we know that the company initially invited 24 people.
2. However, 10 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract those who didn't attend from the initial number.
3. The number of people who attended the luncheon is 24 - 10.

Let's calculate that:

Now, we need to determine how many tables are needed. Since each table can hold 7 people, we can find the number of tables by dividing the total number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold:

$\dfrac{14}{7} = 2$

So, the company needs 2 tables for the luncheon.

To do this, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of pictures in one of the two different albums as ""x.""

So, the number of pictures in the first album is 37, and the number of pictures in the two different albums combined is 41. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$37 + x + x = 41$

Now, we can solve for ""x."" First, simplify the equation:

$37 + 2x = 41$

Next, subtract 37 from both sides of the equation to isolate 2x:

$2x = 41 - 37$

$2x = 4$

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of ""x"":

$x = 4 / 2$

$x = 2$

So, there were 2 pictures in each of the two different albums.

1. First intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.
2. Second intermission: Jonah served 0.4166666666666667 pitcher.

Now, let's simplify the fraction in the second intermission.

2. Second intermission (simplified): Jonah served 5/12 pitcher.
3. Third intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.

Now, we can add these fractions to find the total amount of lemonade Jonah served:

0.25 (first intermission) + 5/12 (second intermission) + 0.25 (third intermission) = 0.25 + 5/12 + 0.25

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 12:

0.25 = 3/12 (since 0.25 is equivalent to 3/12)

Now we can add the fractions:

3/12 + 5/12 + 3/12 = 11/12

So, Jonah served a total of 11/12 pitchers of lemonade during the three intermissions.

Now, let's convert this fraction to a decimal:

We know that 8 out of 100 women over the age of 35 were married 2 or more times in the random sample. We want to find out how many women out of 5,000 would likely be married 2 or more times based on this sample.

We can set up a proportion:

$\frac{8}{100} = \frac{x}{5000}$

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

$8 \times 5000 = 100 \times x$

Now, calculate the right side:

$40000 = 100x$

To solve for 'x', divide both sides by 100:

$\frac{40000}{100} = \frac{100x}{100}$

Simplify:

$400 = x$

So, in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35, approximately 400 of them would likely be married 2 or more times based on the study results.

To find out how much longer it will take to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we can calculate the total time it would take to paint all 9 rooms and then subtract the time already spent.

Total time to paint 9 rooms = 9 rooms * 8 hours per room = 72 hours
Time already spent painting 5 rooms = 5 rooms * 8 hours per room = 40 hours

Now, let's subtract the time already spent from the total time to find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest:

Total time - Time already spent = 72 hours - 40 hours = 32 hours

So, the painter will take 32 more hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Total students who tried out = 66 students

Now, we can subtract the number of students who got called back from the total students who tried out:

Total students who didn't make the cut = Total students who tried out - Number of students called back

1. We know that Katie scored 4 points.
2. The rest of the team scored 4 points each.
3. Let's call the number of other players on her team ""N"".

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total points scored:

Katie's points + Other players' points = Total points
4 + 4N = 12

4. Now, we can solve for N by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 4 from both sides:

Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is represented by ""x"" and the number of hours it operates is represented by ""y"".

According to the problem, we know that when the machine operates for 8 hours, it can make 2088 gears. We can write this as:

$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2088}{8}$

To find out how many gears the machine can make in 9 hours, we need to solve for ""x"" when ""y"" is equal to 9. We can set up a new proportion using this information:

$\frac{x}{9} = \frac{2088}{8}$

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply and then divide:

$8x = 2088 \times 9$

$8x = 18792$

$x = \frac{18792}{8}$

$x = 2349$

After purchasing these books, the library now has a total of 8582 books. This can be represented as $x + 2647 = 8582$.

To find the value of $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2647 from both sides of the equation:

2. After the first 95 minutes, each additional minute costs $2.50.

Let M represent the number of minutes over 112 that the cell phone was in use. So, the equation to calculate the bill in dollars would be:

Change in Inquiries = 79 - 15 = 64

Next, calculate the change in weeks, which is the difference between the fourth week and the first week (which is 4 weeks - 1 week = 3 weeks):

Change in Weeks = 4 - 1 = 3

Now, you can use the formula to find the average rate of change:

Where:
- P is the principal amount (initial investment)
- R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- T is the time the money is invested (in years)

In this case, David had $4,000 invested at a rate of 6% for 0.25 of a year. We need to convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

R = 6% = 0.06

T = 0.25 year

Now, we can calculate the interest:

Simple Interest = $4000 x 0.06 x 0.25

$240 x 0.25 = $60

So, David earned $60 in interest.

Let's call the number of games she needs to give away ""x.""

Kelly starts with 121 games, gives away ""x"" games, and ends up with 22 games:

$121 - x = 22$

Now, we need to isolate ""x"" on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 121 from both sides:

$121 - x - 121 = 22 - 121$

Simplifying the equation:

$-x = -99$

Now, we need to solve for ""x"" by multiplying both sides by -1 to make ""x"" positive:

$-1 \cdot (-x) = -1 \cdot (-99)$

This gives us:

$x = 99$

So, Kelly needs to give away 99 Nintendo games to have 22 games left.

There are $12$ students and $3$ adults going on the field trip. So the total number of people is $12 + 3 = 15$ people.

Each van can hold $5$ people. To determine how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:

$15$ people $/$ $5$ people per van $=$ $3$ vans 

However, since they need whole vans, they will actually need $2$ vans since $2$ vans can hold $10$ people and $3$ vans would be more than needed.

So the number of vans they will need is $2$ vans."

\[
\text{Percent Discount} = \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Original Price}} \times 100\%
\]

In this case, the original price of the shoes was $42, and the discounted price was $33. So, let's calculate the percent discount step by step:

\[
\text{Percent Discount} = \frac{42 - 33}{42} \times 100
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
42 - 33 = 9
\]

Next, divide this by the original price:

\[
\frac{9}{42}
\]

Now, convert this fraction to a decimal:

\[
\frac{9}{42} = 0.21428571429
\]

Finally, multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage:

\[
0.21428571429 \times 100 = 21.43

So, the percent discount on the pair of shoes is approximately 21.43%.

The proportion will relate the cost to the weight of apples. 

Given:
Cost for 75 pounds of apples = $3

We want to find the cost for 3 pounds of apples.

Let's set up the proportion:

$3 / 75 pounds = Cost for 3 pounds / 3 pounds

Now, we can solve for the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" using cross-multiplication:

$3 * 3 pounds = $75 * Cost for 3 pounds

9 pounds = 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

To find the cost for 3 pounds of apples, we need to isolate the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 75:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 pounds) / 75

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 pounds of apples:

Cost for 3 pounds = 9 / 75

Simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 / 3) / (75 / 3)

Cost for 3 pounds = 3 / 25

So, the cost for 3 pounds of apples at the same rate is $3/25.

According to the information given, Fred has 110 blue marbles, and Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. So, we can express this relationship as:

Fred's blue marbles = Tim's blue marbles + 22 * Tim's blue marbles

We are given that Fred has 110 blue marbles, so we can write this equation as:

110 = B + 22B

Now, let's combine like terms:

110 = 1B + 22B

Now, we can simplify this equation:

1B + 22B = 23B

So, 23B = 110

Now, we can solve for B by dividing both sides by 23:

B = 110 / 23

Now, let's calculate B:

$B = \frac{110}{23}$

#### B = 4.78 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Tim has approximately 4.78 blue marbles.

#### Tim has 4.78 blue marbles (rounded to two decimal places)."

Here, the Principal is $8100, the Rate is 15%, and the Time is 1 year.

Let's plug in the values into the formula:

Interest = $8100 * 15% * 1 year

To calculate the interest, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

Interest = $8100 * 0.15 * 1 year

Now, we can simplify the expression:

Interest = $8100 * 0.15

To find the product of $8100 and 0.15, we multiply them:

Interest = $1215

Therefore, the interest you will pay on a $8100 loan for 1 year at a 15% interest rate is $1215.

Initial number of pigs + Number of pigs that came to join = Total number of pigs

Using the given information, we can write the equation as:

64 + x = 86

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by isolating it on one side of the equation:

Subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:

x = 86 - 64

Now, perform the subtraction:

x = 22

So, 22 pigs came to join the initial 64 pigs.

$50 - \text{Games Given Away} = 35$

Now, let's solve for the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

$50 - \text{Games Given Away} = 35$

Subtract 35 from both sides:

$50 - 35 = 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

$15 = 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

Now, to isolate the variable ""Games Given Away,"" we can subtract 35 from both sides:

$15 - 35 = 35 - 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

$-20 = -\text{Games Given Away}$

Finally, we can multiply both sides by -1 to find the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

$-1 \cdot (-20) = \text{Games Given Away}$

$20 = \text{Games Given Away}$

So, Kelly needs to give away 20 Nintendo games to have 35 games left.

Total sodas = 4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas)

Now, we'll calculate how many shelves he would fill up:

Total shelves = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
Total shelves = (4 + 52) / 7

1. Tommy had some balloons, so let's represent the number of balloons he initially had with a variable, say ""B.""

2. Tommy's mom gave him 34 more balloons for his birthday. So, we can represent this as an addition: B + 34.

3. After receiving these additional balloons, Tommy had 60 balloons in total. We can represent this as an equation: B + 34 = 60.

Now, to find out how many balloons Tommy had to start with (the value of B), we need to isolate B by subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation:

B + 34 - 34 = 60 - 34.

This simplifies to:

B = 26.

So, Tommy initially had 26 balloons.

Step 1: Determine how many whole boxes Nathan ate:
Nathan ate 20 gumballs, and each box contains 5 gumballs, so we can find the number of whole boxes he ate by dividing the total number of gumballs he ate by the number of gumballs per box:
$ 20 / 5 = 4 $ whole boxes.

Step 2: Calculate how many gumballs he has left:
To find out how many gumballs Nathan has left, we need to subtract the gumballs he ate from the total number of gumballs:
$ Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = Total\,gumballs - 20 $

Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs Nathan has left:
If we assume that Nathan started with a certain number of gumballs, let's call it ""X,"" then we can express the equation as:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs $

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gumballs in a box and the total number of gumballs Nathan has left:
Each box contains 5 gumballs, and Nathan ate 4 whole boxes, so we can calculate the total number of gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate:
$ 4 * 5 = 20 $ gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate.

Step 5: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now, we can use the equation from step 3 to calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs $

Step 6: Find the value of X (the total number of gumballs Nathan started with):
$ X = Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 $

So, Nathan started with 40 gumballs.

Step 7: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now that we know he started with 40 gumballs, we can use the equation from step 5 to find out how many gumballs he has left:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 $

Nathan has 20 gumballs left.

The answer is:
Nathan ate 4 whole boxes of gumballs, and he has 20 gumballs left.

To find how many miles he walks by the 8th week, we can calculate the sum of the first 8 terms of this arithmetic sequence.

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:

Sum = (n/2) * [2 * a + (n - 1) * d]

Where:
- Sum is the sum of the first n terms.
- n is the number of terms.
- a is the first term.
- d is the common difference between the terms.

In this case, the first term (a) is 10 miles, the common difference (d) is 2 miles, and we want to find the sum of the first 8 terms (n = 8).

Let's plug these values into the formula:

Sum = (8/2) * [2 * 10 + (8 - 1) * 2]

Sum = 4 * [20 + 7 * 2]

Now, calculate the expression inside the brackets:

Sum = 4 * (20 + 14)

If number2 puppies a day are adopted ,",how long would it take for all of them to be adopted ?,,[],1829,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The pet shelter initially had 17 puppies.
2. Another 55 puppies were brought in, so now they have a total of 17 + 55 puppies.
3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can set up an equation. We need to find the number of days it takes for the total number of puppies to reach zero.

Starting with the total number of puppies:
$Total = 17 + 55$

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. Let's call this ""d"" (the number of days).

Each day, 8 puppies are adopted, so we can subtract 8 for each day:
$Total - 8d = 0$

Now, we can solve for ""d"" to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted:
$17 + 55 - 8d = 0$

$72 - 8d = 0$

$8d = 72$

To isolate ""d,"" we can divide both sides by 8:
$d = \frac{72}{8}$

$d = 9$

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

By",what percent would his petroleum bill be changed ?,,[],1853,"To find the percent change in the consumer's petroleum bill after the price of petroleum oil went up by 10% and the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percent, we can use the following steps:

1. Let's assume the original price of petroleum oil is $100, and the original oil consumption is 100 units for simplicity. This is just an arbitrary choice to make the calculations easier.

2. After the price of petroleum oil went up by 10%, the new price is $110 ($100 + 10% of $100).

3. The consumer reduces oil consumption by 10%, which means they now consume 90 units of oil (100 units - 10% of 100 units).

4. To calculate the new petroleum bill, we multiply the new price by the new consumption: $110 * 90 = $9900.

5. Now, let's calculate the percent change in the petroleum bill. We'll compare the new bill of $9900 to the original bill of $10000.

Percent Change = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100
Percent Change = (($9900 - $10000) / $10000) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percent change:

Percent Change = (($9900 - $10000) / $10000) * 100 = (-$100 / $10000) * 100 = -1%

So, the consumer's petroleum bill would be changed by a decrease of 1%.

We know that she drove 204 miles using 10 gallons of gas, so we can write:

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:

$204 * x = 10 * 255$

$204x = 2550$

Now, divide both sides by 204 to isolate $x$:

$x = \frac{2550}{204}$

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

$x = \frac{25 \cdot 102}{2 \cdot 102}$

$x = \frac{25}{2}$

So, Lena would need $25/2$ or 12.5 gallons of gas to drive 255 miles at the same rate.

- Sale Price = $46

Let's plug these values into the formula:

1. ""Some oranges were in the basket.""
Let's represent the number of oranges in the basket with a variable, say $x$.

2. ""5 oranges were taken from the basket.""
This means 5 oranges were removed from the basket, so we subtract 5 from the number of oranges in the basket.

3. ""Now there are 3 oranges.""
This tells us that after removing 5 oranges, there are 3 oranges left in the basket.

Now, we can set up the equation:

$ x - 5 = 3 $

To find the value of $x$, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate $x:

$ x - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5 $

This simplifies to:

$ x = 8 $

So, there were 8 oranges in the basket before some of the oranges were taken.

Step 1: Whole boxes Louis ate
$54 / 6 = 9$

Louis ate 9 whole boxes of Lemon Heads.

Step 2: Lemon Heads Louis has left
$54 \mod 6 = 0$

Louis has 0 Lemon Heads left after eating the 54.

So, Louis ate 9 whole boxes of Lemon Heads, and he has 0 Lemon Heads left.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of cards John has: 
   New cards + Old cards = 8 + 16 = 24 cards.

2. Next, determine how many pages he would need. Each page holds 3 cards, so we can use division to find the number of pages:
   Total cards ÷ Cards per page = 24 ÷ 3 = 8 pages.

So, John would need 8 pages to organize his 8 new cards and 16 old cards in a binder with 3 cards on each page.

"A lawyer bills her clients number0 dollars per hour of service .

If a client 's case requires number1 hours to complete , use proportion to calculate",how much the client will owe the lawyer in dollars .,,[],237,"To calculate how much the client will owe the lawyer for 39 hours of service at a rate of $200 per hour, you can set up a proportion:

Let ""x"" be the amount the client owes in dollars.

$200 per hour is equivalent to 1 hour / $200.

So, the proportion would be:

1 hour / $200 = 39 hours / x

Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for ""x"":

1 * x = 39 * $200

x = 39 * $200

Now, calculate the value of ""x"":

x = 7800

So, the client will owe the lawyer $7800 for 39 hours of service.
