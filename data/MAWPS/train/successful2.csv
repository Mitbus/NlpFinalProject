edward spent 13 . now he has 6 . how much did edward have before he spent his money ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Edward spent <<13.
2. After spending, he has >>6 left.

To find out how much Edward had before he spent his money, we can set up an equation:

Let X be the amount Edward had before spending.
