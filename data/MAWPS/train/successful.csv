There are 22 walnut trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant walnut trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 55 walnut trees in the park . How many walnut trees did the workers plant today ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: We are given that there are 22 walnut trees in the park currently.

Step 2: The park workers will plant some walnut trees today, and when they are finished, there will be a total of 55 walnut trees in the park.

To find out how many walnut trees the workers planted today, we can set up an equation:

Current number of walnut trees + Walnut trees planted today = Total number of walnut trees after planting

Using the information we have:

22 (current number) + Walnut trees planted today = 55 (total number after planting)

Step 3: Now, let's isolate the variable ""Walnut trees planted today"" by subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation:

Walnut trees planted today = 55 - 22

Step 4: Perform the subtraction to find the number of walnut trees the workers planted today:

 55 - 22 = << 55 - 22 = 33 >> 33 

So, the workers planted 33 walnut trees today.

adam picked 35 strawberries . after eating some he had 33 left . how many strawberries did adam eat ?,"To find out how many strawberries Adam ate, we can set up a simple subtraction problem.

Adam picked 35 strawberries, and after eating some, he had 33 left. We can represent this situation with the following equation:

35 - X = <<35 - X = 33>> 33

Where X represents the number of strawberries Adam ate.

To solve for X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation:

Simplifying this:

2 - X = <<2 - X = 0>> 0

Now, to isolate X, we can add X to both sides of the equation:

2 - X + X = <<2 - X + X = 0 + X>> 0 + X

Simplifying:

2 = <<2 = X>> X

So, Adam ate 2 strawberries.

Each page holds 8 cards, and Dave has 3 new cards and 13 old cards to put in the binder. We can calculate the total number of cards he needs to organize and then divide by 8 to find the number of pages required.

Total number of cards = 3 (new cards) + 13 (old cards) = 16 cards

Now, we'll divide the total number of cards by the number of cards per page:

 16 / 8 = << 16 / 8 = 2 >> 2 

Dave would need 2 pages to organize his 16 cards.

ned was helping the cafeteria workers pick up lunch trays but he could only carry 8 trays at a time . if he had to pick up 27 trays from 1 table and 5 trays from another how many trips will he make ?,"To find out how many trips Ned will make to pick up 27 trays from one table and 5 trays from another, we can set up a simple division problem. We'll divide the total number of trays by the number of trays Ned can carry at a time.

First, we'll calculate the total number of trays Ned needs to pick up:
27>> trays from the first table + <<5>> trays from the second table = <<27>> trays from the first table + <<5>> trays from the second table = <<27 + 5>> <<27 + 5

Now, we'll divide this total by the number of trays Ned can carry in one trip (8 trays per trip):
<<(27 + 5) / 8>>

Let's calculate this division:
(27 + 5) / 8 = <<(27 + 5) / 8 = 32 / 8 = 4>> 32 / 8 = 4

So, Ned will make 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

a vase can hold 9 flowers . if you had 4 carnations and 23 roses how many vases would you need to hold the flowers ?,"To determine how many vases are needed to hold the flowers, we can find the total number of flowers and then divide by the maximum number of flowers a single vase can hold (which is 9).

First, we add the number of carnations and roses together:

4 + 23 = <<4 + 23 = 27>> 27

Now, we'll calculate how many vases are needed to hold the 27 flowers. We can do this by dividing the total number of flowers by the number of flowers a single vase can hold:

27 / 9 = <<27 / 9 = 3>> 3

So, you would need 3 vases to hold the 27 flowers.

gwen 's class is going on a field trip to the zoo . if each van can hold 7 people and there are 33 students and 9 adults going how many vans will they need ?,"To find out how many vans Gwen's class will need for the field trip to the zoo, we can use division to calculate the number of vans required.

First, let's find the total number of people (students and adults) going on the field trip:

Total number of students = 33
Total number of adults = 9

Now, add these two numbers together to get the total number of people:

 33 + 9 = << 33 + 9 = 42 >> 42 

So, there will be 42 people going on the field trip.

Next, we need to determine how many people each van can hold. The problem states that each van can hold 7 people.

Now, to find the number of vans needed, we can divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:

 42 / 7 = << 42 / 7 = 6 >> 6 

Therefore, Gwen's class will need 6 vans for the field trip to the zoo.

a trivia team had 9 members total but during a game 3 members did n't show up . if each member that did show up scored 2 points how many points were scored total ?,"Sure, let's solve this step by step.

Initially, the team had 9 members. However, 3 members didn't show up, so the number of members that did show up is the total number of members (9) minus the number of members that didn't show up (3).

So, the number of members that did show up is 9 - 3 = <<9 - 3 = 6>> 6.

Each member that did show up scored 2 points. Therefore, to find the total points scored, we need to multiply the number of members that showed up (6) by the points each member scored (2).

Hence, the total points scored is <<6 * 2>>.

Now we just need to perform the multiplication:

6 * 2 = <<6 * 2 = 12>> 12

isabel had some candy . she gave her friend 27 pieces and had 61 left . how many pieces did she have to start with ?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Isabel had to start with, we can set up an equation.

Let's call the number of pieces Isabel had to start with ""X.""

According to the information given, she gave her friend 27 pieces and had 61 left. We can express this as an equation:

X - 27 = <<X - 27 = 61>> 61

Now, we want to isolate X on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to get rid of the -27 on the left side. We can achieve this by adding 27 to both sides of the equation:

X - 27 + 27 = <<X - 27 + 27 = 61 + 27>> 61 + 27

This simplifies to:

X = <<X = 88>> 88

So, Isabel had 88 pieces of candy to start with.
