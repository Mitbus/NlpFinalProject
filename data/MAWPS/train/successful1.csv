There are 22 walnut trees currently in the park . Park workers will plant walnut trees today . When the workers are finished there will be 55 walnut trees in the park . How many walnut trees did the workers plant today ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: We are given that there are 22 walnut trees in the park currently.

Step 2: The park workers will plant some walnut trees today, and when they are finished, there will be a total of 55 walnut trees in the park.

To find out how many walnut trees the workers planted today, we can set up an equation:

Current number of walnut trees + Walnut trees planted today = Total number of walnut trees after planting

Using the information we have:

22 (current number) + Walnut trees planted today = 55 (total number after planting)

Step 3: Now, let's isolate the variable ""Walnut trees planted today"" by subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation:

Walnut trees planted today = 55 - 22

Step 4: Perform the subtraction to find the number of walnut trees the workers planted today:

 55 - 22 = << 55 - 22 = 33 >> 33 

So, the workers planted 33 walnut trees today.

"The school cafeteria had 38 apples . If they used 20 to make lunch for the students and then bought 28 more , how many apples would they have ?","To solve this problem step by step, we can follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of apples in the cafeteria, which is 38.
2. Subtract the number of apples used to make lunch for the students, which is 20.
3. Add the number of apples bought, which is 28.

Luke had 20 stickers . He bought 12 stickers from a store in the mall and got 20 stickers for his birthday . Then Luke gave 5 of the stickers to his sister and used 8 to decorate a greeting card . How many stickers does Luke have left ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Luke starts with 20 stickers.
2. He buys 12 stickers from the store, so he now has 20 + 12 stickers.
3. He also receives 20 stickers for his birthday, so he now has 20 + 12 + 20 stickers.
4. Luke gives 5 stickers to his sister, which means he has 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 stickers left.
5. He uses 8 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which leaves him with 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 - 8 stickers.

Now, let's calculate the final number of stickers Luke has left:

<< 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 - 8 >>

First, add the numbers in the parentheses:

 20 + 12 + 20 = << 20 + 12 + 20 = 52 >> 52 

Now, subtract 5:

 52 - 5 = << 52 - 5 = 47 >> 47 

Finally, subtract 8:

 47 - 8 = << 47 - 8 = 39 >> 39 

So, Luke has 39 stickers left.
