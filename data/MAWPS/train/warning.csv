Simple Interest ($SI$) = Principal ($P$) × Rate ($R$) × Time ($T$)

Where:
- $P$ is the principal amount (initial deposit),
- $R$ is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- $T$ is the time in years.

In this case:
- $P$ = $70$ dollars
- $R$ = $3\%$, which is equivalent to $0.03$ in decimal form
- $T$ = $2$ years

Now, plug these values into the formula:

$SI$ = $70$ × $0.03$ × $2$

Now, calculate each part of the formula:

15 - 8 = 7

So, the chef still needs to cook 7 potatoes. 

Since each potato takes 9 minutes to cook, we can multiply the number of potatoes still needed by the cooking time for each potato to find out how long it will take to cook the rest. 

Number of potatoes still needed * Cooking time per potato = Total cooking time for the rest

7 * 9 = 63

Therefore, it will take the chef 63 minutes to cook the rest of the potatoes.

Let's denote the selling price as $S$.

The dealer's profit should be 25% of the selling price, which means:

Profit = 25% of $S$

25% can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100, so:

Profit = 0.25 * $S$

Now, to find the selling price that includes this profit, we need to add the profit to the cost price:

Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
$S = $6000 + (0.25 * $S)$

1. First, we know that the company initially invited 24 people.
2. However, 10 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract those who didn't attend from the initial number.
3. The number of people who attended the luncheon is 24 - 10.

Let's calculate that:

Now, we need to determine how many tables are needed. Since each table can hold 7 people, we can find the number of tables by dividing the total number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold:

$\dfrac{14}{7} = 2$

So, the company needs 2 tables for the luncheon.

To do this, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of pictures in one of the two different albums as ""x.""

So, the number of pictures in the first album is 37, and the number of pictures in the two different albums combined is 41. Therefore, we can write the equation:

$37 + x + x = 41$

Now, we can solve for ""x."" First, simplify the equation:

$37 + 2x = 41$

Next, subtract 37 from both sides of the equation to isolate 2x:

$2x = 41 - 37$

$2x = 4$

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of ""x"":

$x = 4 / 2$

$x = 2$

So, there were 2 pictures in each of the two different albums.

1. First intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.
2. Second intermission: Jonah served 0.4166666666666667 pitcher.

Now, let's simplify the fraction in the second intermission.

2. Second intermission (simplified): Jonah served 5/12 pitcher.
3. Third intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.

Now, we can add these fractions to find the total amount of lemonade Jonah served:

0.25 (first intermission) + 5/12 (second intermission) + 0.25 (third intermission) = 0.25 + 5/12 + 0.25

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 12:

0.25 = 3/12 (since 0.25 is equivalent to 3/12)

Now we can add the fractions:

3/12 + 5/12 + 3/12 = 11/12

So, Jonah served a total of 11/12 pitchers of lemonade during the three intermissions.

Now, let's convert this fraction to a decimal:

We know that 8 out of 100 women over the age of 35 were married 2 or more times in the random sample. We want to find out how many women out of 5,000 would likely be married 2 or more times based on this sample.

We can set up a proportion:

$\frac{8}{100} = \frac{x}{5000}$

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

$8 \times 5000 = 100 \times x$

Now, calculate the right side:

$40000 = 100x$

To solve for 'x', divide both sides by 100:

$\frac{40000}{100} = \frac{100x}{100}$

Simplify:

$400 = x$

So, in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35, approximately 400 of them would likely be married 2 or more times based on the study results.

To find out how much longer it will take to paint the remaining 4 rooms, we can calculate the total time it would take to paint all 9 rooms and then subtract the time already spent.

Total time to paint 9 rooms = 9 rooms * 8 hours per room = 72 hours
Time already spent painting 5 rooms = 5 rooms * 8 hours per room = 40 hours

Now, let's subtract the time already spent from the total time to find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest:

Total time - Time already spent = 72 hours - 40 hours = 32 hours

So, the painter will take 32 more hours to paint the remaining 4 rooms.

Total students who tried out = 66 students

Now, we can subtract the number of students who got called back from the total students who tried out:

Total students who didn't make the cut = Total students who tried out - Number of students called back

1. We know that Katie scored 4 points.
2. The rest of the team scored 4 points each.
3. Let's call the number of other players on her team ""N"".

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total points scored:

Katie's points + Other players' points = Total points
4 + 4N = 12

4. Now, we can solve for N by isolating it on one side of the equation. First, subtract 4 from both sides:

Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is represented by ""x"" and the number of hours it operates is represented by ""y"".

According to the problem, we know that when the machine operates for 8 hours, it can make 2088 gears. We can write this as:

$\frac{x}{y} = \frac{2088}{8}$

To find out how many gears the machine can make in 9 hours, we need to solve for ""x"" when ""y"" is equal to 9. We can set up a new proportion using this information:

$\frac{x}{9} = \frac{2088}{8}$

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply and then divide:

$8x = 2088 \times 9$

$8x = 18792$

$x = \frac{18792}{8}$

$x = 2349$

After purchasing these books, the library now has a total of 8582 books. This can be represented as $x + 2647 = 8582$.

To find the value of $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2647 from both sides of the equation:

2. After the first 95 minutes, each additional minute costs $2.50.

Let M represent the number of minutes over 112 that the cell phone was in use. So, the equation to calculate the bill in dollars would be:

Change in Inquiries = 79 - 15 = 64

Next, calculate the change in weeks, which is the difference between the fourth week and the first week (which is 4 weeks - 1 week = 3 weeks):

Change in Weeks = 4 - 1 = 3

Now, you can use the formula to find the average rate of change:

Where:
- P is the principal amount (initial investment)
- R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- T is the time the money is invested (in years)

In this case, David had $4,000 invested at a rate of 6% for 0.25 of a year. We need to convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

R = 6% = 0.06

T = 0.25 year

Now, we can calculate the interest:

Simple Interest = $4000 x 0.06 x 0.25

$240 x 0.25 = $60

So, David earned $60 in interest.

Let's call the number of games she needs to give away ""x.""

Kelly starts with 121 games, gives away ""x"" games, and ends up with 22 games:

$121 - x = 22$

Now, we need to isolate ""x"" on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 121 from both sides:

$121 - x - 121 = 22 - 121$

Simplifying the equation:

$-x = -99$

Now, we need to solve for ""x"" by multiplying both sides by -1 to make ""x"" positive:

$-1 \cdot (-x) = -1 \cdot (-99)$

This gives us:

$x = 99$

So, Kelly needs to give away 99 Nintendo games to have 22 games left.

There are $12$ students and $3$ adults going on the field trip. So the total number of people is $12 + 3 = 15$ people.

Each van can hold $5$ people. To determine how many vans they will need, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each van can hold:

$15$ people $/$ $5$ people per van $=$ $3$ vans 

However, since they need whole vans, they will actually need $2$ vans since $2$ vans can hold $10$ people and $3$ vans would be more than needed.

So the number of vans they will need is $2$ vans."

\[
\text{Percent Discount} = \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Original Price}} \times 100\%
\]

In this case, the original price of the shoes was $42, and the discounted price was $33. So, let's calculate the percent discount step by step:

\[
\text{Percent Discount} = \frac{42 - 33}{42} \times 100
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
42 - 33 = 9
\]

Next, divide this by the original price:

\[
\frac{9}{42}
\]

Now, convert this fraction to a decimal:

\[
\frac{9}{42} = 0.21428571429
\]

Finally, multiply by 100 to express it as a percentage:

\[
0.21428571429 \times 100 = 21.43

So, the percent discount on the pair of shoes is approximately 21.43%.

The proportion will relate the cost to the weight of apples. 

Given:
Cost for 75 pounds of apples = $3

We want to find the cost for 3 pounds of apples.

Let's set up the proportion:

$3 / 75 pounds = Cost for 3 pounds / 3 pounds

Now, we can solve for the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" using cross-multiplication:

$3 * 3 pounds = $75 * Cost for 3 pounds

9 pounds = 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

To find the cost for 3 pounds of apples, we need to isolate the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 75:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 pounds) / 75

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 pounds of apples:

Cost for 3 pounds = 9 / 75

Simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 / 3) / (75 / 3)

Cost for 3 pounds = 3 / 25

So, the cost for 3 pounds of apples at the same rate is $3/25.

According to the information given, Fred has 110 blue marbles, and Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. So, we can express this relationship as:

Fred's blue marbles = Tim's blue marbles + 22 * Tim's blue marbles

We are given that Fred has 110 blue marbles, so we can write this equation as:

110 = B + 22B

Now, let's combine like terms:

110 = 1B + 22B

Now, we can simplify this equation:

1B + 22B = 23B

So, 23B = 110

Now, we can solve for B by dividing both sides by 23:

B = 110 / 23

Now, let's calculate B:

$B = \frac{110}{23}$

#### B = 4.78 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, Tim has approximately 4.78 blue marbles.

#### Tim has 4.78 blue marbles (rounded to two decimal places)."

Here, the Principal is $8100, the Rate is 15%, and the Time is 1 year.

Let's plug in the values into the formula:

Interest = $8100 * 15% * 1 year

To calculate the interest, we need to convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

Interest = $8100 * 0.15 * 1 year

Now, we can simplify the expression:

Interest = $8100 * 0.15

To find the product of $8100 and 0.15, we multiply them:

Interest = $1215

Therefore, the interest you will pay on a $8100 loan for 1 year at a 15% interest rate is $1215.

Initial number of pigs + Number of pigs that came to join = Total number of pigs

Using the given information, we can write the equation as:

64 + x = 86

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by isolating it on one side of the equation:

Subtract 64 from both sides of the equation:

x = 86 - 64

Now, perform the subtraction:

x = 22

So, 22 pigs came to join the initial 64 pigs.

$50 - \text{Games Given Away} = 35$

Now, let's solve for the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

$50 - \text{Games Given Away} = 35$

Subtract 35 from both sides:

$50 - 35 = 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

$15 = 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

Now, to isolate the variable ""Games Given Away,"" we can subtract 35 from both sides:

$15 - 35 = 35 - 35 - \text{Games Given Away}$

$-20 = -\text{Games Given Away}$

Finally, we can multiply both sides by -1 to find the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

$-1 \cdot (-20) = \text{Games Given Away}$

$20 = \text{Games Given Away}$

So, Kelly needs to give away 20 Nintendo games to have 35 games left.

Total sodas = 4 (regular sodas) + 52 (diet sodas)

Now, we'll calculate how many shelves he would fill up:

Total shelves = Total sodas / Sodas per shelf
Total shelves = (4 + 52) / 7

1. Tommy had some balloons, so let's represent the number of balloons he initially had with a variable, say ""B.""

2. Tommy's mom gave him 34 more balloons for his birthday. So, we can represent this as an addition: B + 34.

3. After receiving these additional balloons, Tommy had 60 balloons in total. We can represent this as an equation: B + 34 = 60.

Now, to find out how many balloons Tommy had to start with (the value of B), we need to isolate B by subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation:

B + 34 - 34 = 60 - 34.

This simplifies to:

B = 26.

So, Tommy initially had 26 balloons.

Step 1: Determine how many whole boxes Nathan ate:
Nathan ate 20 gumballs, and each box contains 5 gumballs, so we can find the number of whole boxes he ate by dividing the total number of gumballs he ate by the number of gumballs per box:
$ 20 / 5 = 4 $ whole boxes.

Step 2: Calculate how many gumballs he has left:
To find out how many gumballs Nathan has left, we need to subtract the gumballs he ate from the total number of gumballs:
$ Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = Total\,gumballs - 20 $

Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs Nathan has left:
If we assume that Nathan started with a certain number of gumballs, let's call it ""X,"" then we can express the equation as:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs $

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gumballs in a box and the total number of gumballs Nathan has left:
Each box contains 5 gumballs, and Nathan ate 4 whole boxes, so we can calculate the total number of gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate:
$ 4 * 5 = 20 $ gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate.

Step 5: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now, we can use the equation from step 3 to calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs $

Step 6: Find the value of X (the total number of gumballs Nathan started with):
$ X = Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 $

So, Nathan started with 40 gumballs.

Step 7: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now that we know he started with 40 gumballs, we can use the equation from step 5 to find out how many gumballs he has left:
$ X - 20 = Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 $

Nathan has 20 gumballs left.

The answer is:
Nathan ate 4 whole boxes of gumballs, and he has 20 gumballs left.

To find how many miles he walks by the 8th week, we can calculate the sum of the first 8 terms of this arithmetic sequence.

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:

Sum = (n/2) * [2 * a + (n - 1) * d]

Where:
- Sum is the sum of the first n terms.
- n is the number of terms.
- a is the first term.
- d is the common difference between the terms.

In this case, the first term (a) is 10 miles, the common difference (d) is 2 miles, and we want to find the sum of the first 8 terms (n = 8).

Let's plug these values into the formula:

Sum = (8/2) * [2 * 10 + (8 - 1) * 2]

Sum = 4 * [20 + 7 * 2]

Now, calculate the expression inside the brackets:

Sum = 4 * (20 + 14)

If number2 puppies a day are adopted ,",how long would it take for all of them to be adopted ?,,[],1829,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The pet shelter initially had 17 puppies.
2. Another 55 puppies were brought in, so now they have a total of 17 + 55 puppies.
3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can set up an equation. We need to find the number of days it takes for the total number of puppies to reach zero.

Starting with the total number of puppies:
$Total = 17 + 55$

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. Let's call this ""d"" (the number of days).

Each day, 8 puppies are adopted, so we can subtract 8 for each day:
$Total - 8d = 0$

Now, we can solve for ""d"" to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted:
$17 + 55 - 8d = 0$

$72 - 8d = 0$

$8d = 72$

To isolate ""d,"" we can divide both sides by 8:
$d = \frac{72}{8}$

$d = 9$

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

By",what percent would his petroleum bill be changed ?,,[],1853,"To find the percent change in the consumer's petroleum bill after the price of petroleum oil went up by 10% and the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percent, we can use the following steps:

1. Let's assume the original price of petroleum oil is $100, and the original oil consumption is 100 units for simplicity. This is just an arbitrary choice to make the calculations easier.

2. After the price of petroleum oil went up by 10%, the new price is $110 ($100 + 10% of $100).

3. The consumer reduces oil consumption by 10%, which means they now consume 90 units of oil (100 units - 10% of 100 units).

4. To calculate the new petroleum bill, we multiply the new price by the new consumption: $110 * 90 = $9900.

5. Now, let's calculate the percent change in the petroleum bill. We'll compare the new bill of $9900 to the original bill of $10000.

Percent Change = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100
Percent Change = (($9900 - $10000) / $10000) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percent change:

Percent Change = (($9900 - $10000) / $10000) * 100 = (-$100 / $10000) * 100 = -1%

So, the consumer's petroleum bill would be changed by a decrease of 1%.

We know that she drove 204 miles using 10 gallons of gas, so we can write:

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:

$204 * x = 10 * 255$

$204x = 2550$

Now, divide both sides by 204 to isolate $x$:

$x = \frac{2550}{204}$

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

$x = \frac{25 \cdot 102}{2 \cdot 102}$

$x = \frac{25}{2}$

So, Lena would need $25/2$ or 12.5 gallons of gas to drive 255 miles at the same rate.

- Sale Price = $46

Let's plug these values into the formula:

1. ""Some oranges were in the basket.""
Let's represent the number of oranges in the basket with a variable, say $x$.

2. ""5 oranges were taken from the basket.""
This means 5 oranges were removed from the basket, so we subtract 5 from the number of oranges in the basket.

3. ""Now there are 3 oranges.""
This tells us that after removing 5 oranges, there are 3 oranges left in the basket.

Now, we can set up the equation:

$ x - 5 = 3 $

To find the value of $x$, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate $x:

$ x - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5 $

This simplifies to:

$ x = 8 $

So, there were 8 oranges in the basket before some of the oranges were taken.

Step 1: Whole boxes Louis ate
$54 / 6 = 9$

Louis ate 9 whole boxes of Lemon Heads.

Step 2: Lemon Heads Louis has left
$54 \mod 6 = 0$

Louis has 0 Lemon Heads left after eating the 54.

So, Louis ate 9 whole boxes of Lemon Heads, and he has 0 Lemon Heads left.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of cards John has: 
   New cards + Old cards = 8 + 16 = 24 cards.

2. Next, determine how many pages he would need. Each page holds 3 cards, so we can use division to find the number of pages:
   Total cards ÷ Cards per page = 24 ÷ 3 = 8 pages.

So, John would need 8 pages to organize his 8 new cards and 16 old cards in a binder with 3 cards on each page.

Let ""x"" be the amount the client owes in dollars.

$200 per hour is equivalent to 1 hour / $200.

So, the proportion would be:

1 hour / $200 = 39 hours / x

Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for ""x"":

1 * x = 39 * $200

x = 39 * $200

Now, calculate the value of ""x"":

x = 7800

So, the client will owe the lawyer $7800 for 39 hours of service.

Given that each section of the orchard produces 45 sacks of apples daily, and there are 8 sections in total, we can calculate the total number of sacks harvested each day by multiplying the number of sacks per section by the number of sections.

Number of sacks per section = 45
Number of sections = 8

Total number of sacks harvested daily = Number of sacks per section * Number of sections

Total number of sacks harvested daily = 45 * 8

Next, we need to calculate the number of apples in each sack. Since the question does not provide this information, we will assume a value for the number of apples in each sack. Let's assume there are 50 apples in each sack.

To find the total number of apples harvested daily, we need to multiply the total number of sacks harvested daily by the number of apples in each sack.

Total number of apples harvested daily = Total number of sacks harvested daily * Number of apples in each sack

Total number of apples harvested daily = (45 * 8) * 50

Now we can calculate the total number of apples harvested every day.

#### $261*23= 5,983$

There are several ways that AI models can be trained to solve math problems. One approach is to train a language model to generate solutions directly in natural language, as demonstrated by OpenAI's AI Math Teacher. However, language models often struggle with multistep reasoning and making subtle logical mistakes.

Another approach is to generate code that outputs the solution, as explored by researchers at MIT. They found that simply prompting OpenAI's Codex model with ""write a program"" followed by the problem text was enough to produce correct Python code for around 70% of university-level math problems.

For the given problem, the steps would be:

1. There are $261$ fishbowls 
2. Each fishbowl has $23$ fish
3. To find the total number of fish, multiply the number of fishbowls by the number of fish in each bowl:

$261 * 23 = 5,983$

Generating code to output the solution is helpful because the program can be run multiple times to check for errors. The code can also produce other useful outputs like graphs and plots.

While AI systems are getting better at solving math problems, they still make logical mistakes and require techniques like verification and few-shot learning to reach human-level performance. Progress is also being made on generating new math problems, though human evaluators still find human-created problems to be slightly better suited for educational use.

In summary, by framing math problems as programs that output solutions, AI systems are able to leverage large pre-trained code models to achieve high accuracy on university-level problems. With continued improvements, these techniques show promise for assisting with mathematics education.

Hope this breakdown of the problem and solution helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."

The question states that there were 150 book shelves. It also states that each book shelf had 15 books. To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of books across all 150 shelves.

We can reason as follows:
* There are $150$ book shelves 
* Each book shelf has $15$ books
* To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of books per shelf:
$$150 \times 15 = 2250$$

Therefore, the total number of books on the 150 shelves is $2250$ books."

$1$ small room

So the minimum number of large rooms that need to be rented is $8$ large rooms.

The worm starts at 26 inches deep in the hole.
Every day, it climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches.  
So on the first day, it climbs up 8 inches to 18 inches deep.   
Then it slides back 3 inches to 21 inches deep.    
On the second day, it again climbs up 8 inches to 13 inches deep.  
Then it slides back 3 inches to 16 inches deep.
We need to find how many days it takes for the worm to reach the surface at 0 inches deep.
Let's call the number of days $n$.   
The pattern is:    
The worm climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches every day.
So on day $n$, the worm will climb $8n$ inches total and slide back $3n$ inches.
Since it needs to reach 0 inches deep, we can set up an equation:
$26 - (8n - 3n) = 0$
Solving for $n$:
$26 - 5n = 0$
$5n = 26$
$n = 26/5$
$n = 5$ days

We know that Maura found 75 seashells initially and gave some to her sister. After giving some to her sister, she had 57 seashells left. 

So, we can write the equation: 75 - x = 57.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation.

Starting with 75, subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us: 75 - x - x = 57 - x.

Simplifying the equation gives us: 75 - 2x = 57.

To isolate the variable, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation: 75 - 2x - 75 = 57 - 75.

Simplifying the equation gives us: -2x = -18.

Finally, to solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2x) / -2 = (-18) / -2.

Simplifying the equation gives us: x = 9.

Therefore, Maura gave 9 seashells to her sister.

the central city zoo has number0 chimpanzees . every day the chimps eat a total of number1 bananas . next week the zoo is moving number2 chimps to a new cage . how many chimps will stay in the old cage ?,"[45,72,18]","[-,number0,number2]",27,"[1,4,5,6,38,8,39,40,15,16,17,24,25,26]",the central city zoo has number0 chimpanzees . every day the chimps eat a total of number1 bananas . next week the zoo is moving number2 chimps to a new cage .,how many chimps will stay in the old cage ?,,[],2517,"Let's start by finding out how many bananas each chimp eats per day. To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of chimps.

Total bananas per day = 72
Number of chimps = 45

So, bananas per chimp per day = Total bananas per day / Number of chimps

Bananas per chimp per day = 72 / 45 = 1.6 bananas

Next, let's find out how many bananas the 18 chimps that are being moved eat per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas per chimp per day by the number of chimps being moved.

Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas
Number of chimps being moved = 18

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = Bananas per chimp per day * Number of chimps being moved

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 1.6 * 18 = 28.8 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas the remaining chimps in the old cage eat per day. We can do this by subtracting the bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day from the total bananas per day.

Total bananas per day = 72 bananas
Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 28.8 bananas

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = Total bananas per day - Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 72 - 28.8 = 43.2 bananas

Since each chimp eats 1.6 bananas per day, we can find out how many chimps will stay in the old cage by dividing the bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day by the number of bananas per chimp per day.

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 43.2 bananas
Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day / Bananas per chimp per day

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = 43.2 / 1.6 = 27

Therefore, 27 chimps will stay in the old cage.####

Anthony gets 75 cents every day for lunch and he spent 27 cents on a juice box. So, the remaining amount after buying the juice box is given by $75 - 27 = 48$ cents. 

Anthony had 8 cents left after buying the cupcake. We can represent this as $48 - c = 8$. 

To find the cost of the cupcake, we can solve the equation $48 - c = 8$ for $c$. 

Subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation, we have $48 - 48 - c = 8 - 48$. Simplifying, we get $-c = -40$. 

To solve for $c$, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1, giving us $c = 40$. 

Therefore, the cupcake cost 40 cents.

We know that Kevin collected 14 stuffed animals and 18 frisbees, which gives us a total of $14 + 18 = 32$ toys collected. 

Adding the number of yo-yos collected, which is $y$, to the total number of toys collected should give us the total number of prizes Kevin has, which is 50. 

So the equation representing this situation is $32 + y = 50$. 

To find the value of $y$, we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation: 

$32 + y - 32 = 50 - 32$

This simplifies to:

Since he sold 8 fewer hot dogs than chips, we can subtract 8 from the number of bags of chips to find the number of hot dogs:

$27 - 8 = 19$

Jasper sold 19 hot dogs.

Next, we need to determine the number of drinks he sold. 

Since he sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs, we can add 12 to the number of hot dogs to find the number of drinks:

1. Initially, there were 47 bales of hay in the barn.
2. There were also 40 bales in the shed.
3. Benny stacked more bales in the barn today.
4. After stacking, there are now 82 bales of hay in the barn.

To find out how many bales Benny stored in the barn today, we need to subtract the initial number of bales in the barn (47) and the bales that were already in the shed (40) from the current total in the barn (82). This will give us the number of bales Benny added.

So, the calculation is: $82 - 47 - 40$.

Now, let's calculate that:

$82 - 47 - 40 = 82 - 87 = -5$

Benny added -5 bales to the barn. Since this doesn't make sense in a real-world scenario, it's likely there's an error in the problem statement.

1. The high school played 18 baseball games.
2. 2 of these games were at night.
3. The team won most of their games.
4. They were defeated during 3 games.

To find out how many games the team won, we can start by calculating the total number of games they lost and the games they won.

Total Games = 18 (the number of games played)
Games at Night = 2
Games Lost = 3

To find the number of games won, we can use the fact that the team won most of their games, which implies they won more games than they lost. Since there were 18 games in total, and we know they lost 3 games and 2 games were at night, we can calculate the number of games won as follows:

Total Games - (Games Lost + Games at Night) = Games Won
18 - (3 + 2) = Games Won
18 - 5 = Games Won

Now, let's calculate the number of games won:

$18 - 5 = 13$

So, the team won 13 games.

( use the value of pi = number1 ),,[],2689,"To find out how much shorter Chad's trip is if he canoes across the lake rather than walking around it, we need to calculate the circumference of the circular lake and then compare it to the diameter of the lake. Here are the steps:

1. The diameter of the lake is given as 2 miles.

2. To find the circumference of the circular lake, we can use the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is C = πd, where C is the circumference, π is the value of pi (given as 3), and d is the diameter of the circle.

3. Substituting the values into the formula:
   C = 3 * 2

4. Calculate the circumference:
   C = 6 miles

5. Now, we need to find out how much shorter Chad's trip is if he canoes across the lake instead of walking around it. To do this, we subtract the circumference from the diameter:
   Shorter trip = Diameter - Circumference
   Shorter trip = 2 - 6

6. Calculate the difference:
   Shorter trip = -4 miles

Chad's trip is 4 miles shorter if he canoes across the lake instead of walking around it.

a mailman has to give number0 pieces of junk mail to each block . if there are number1 houses on a block how many pieces of junk mail should he give each house ?,"[28,4]","[/,number0,number1]",7,"[32,2,4,5,6,9,11,16,17,18,30,31]",a mailman has to give number0 pieces of junk mail to each block . if there are number1 houses on a block,how many pieces of junk mail should he give each house ?,,[],2726,"To find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give to each house, we can set up a proportion.

Let:
- \(x\) be the number of pieces of junk mail each house should receive.
- 28 be the number of pieces of junk mail given to each block.
- 4 be the number of houses on a block.

We can set up the proportion as follows:

\(\frac{x}{1}\) (pieces of mail per house) = \(\frac{28}{4}\) (pieces of mail per block)

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\(\frac{x}{1} = \frac{28}{4}\)

To solve for \(x\), we can cross-multiply:

\(x \cdot 4 = 28 \cdot 1\)

\(4x = 28\)

Now, divide both sides by 4 to isolate \(x\):

\(x = \frac{28}{4}\)

Simplify the right side:

\(x = 7\)

So, the mailman should give each house 7 pieces of junk mail.

First, let's find out how many bags of chocolate chip cookies she can make. Chloe has 34 chocolate chip cookies, and each bag contains 7 cookies, so we can calculate:

$34 \div 7 = 4.8571$

Since Chloe can't make a fraction of a bag, she can make 4 bags of chocolate chip cookies.

Next, let's find out how many bags of oatmeal cookies she can make. Chloe has 29 oatmeal cookies, and each bag contains 7 cookies, so we can calculate:

$29 \div 7 = 4.1429$

Again, Chloe can't make a fraction of a bag, so she can make 4 bags of oatmeal cookies.

However, he forgot to mow 8 of them. To find out how much money he actually earned, we need to calculate the amount he earned for the lawns he did mow and then subtract the amount he would have earned for the lawns he forgot to mow.

Step 1: Calculate the amount earned for the lawns he did mow.
Number of lawns mowed = 12 - 8 (lawns he forgot to mow) = 4 lawns mowed
Amount earned for the lawns mowed = 4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned.
Amount earned = 4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn - amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow

Step 3: Calculate the amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow.
Amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns = 8 lawns * $9 per lawn

Now, let's calculate the actual amount he earned.

Amount earned = (4 lawns mowed * $9 per lawn) - (8 lawns * $9 per lawn)

Amount earned = ($36) - ($72)

Amount earned = $36 - $72

Amount earned = $-36

So, Adam actually earned -$36, which means he didn't earn any money; he owes $36.

Number of students at the start of the year = 10

Number of new students who came to the school = 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can subtract the number of students who left from the number of students at the start of the year and then add the number of new students who came to the school.

Number of students at the end of the year = (Number of students at the start of the year - Number of students who left) + Number of new students who came to the school

Number of students at the end of the year = (10 - 4) + 42

Calculating the expression inside the parentheses first:
Number of students at the end of the year = 6 + 42

Adding the two numbers together:
Number of students at the end of the year = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

We can do this by finding the cost of the chocolate and carob separately and then adding them together. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Cost of 2 pounds of chocolate:
   The cost of 1 pound of chocolate is $2, so the cost of 2 pounds of chocolate is $2 * 2 = $4.

2. Cost of 55 pounds of carob candy:
   The cost of 1 pound of carob candy is $7, so the cost of 55 pounds of carob candy is $7 * 55 = $385.

3. Total cost of the mixture:
   The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of chocolate and carob candy, so it is $4 + $385 = $389.

4. Total weight of the mixture:
   The total weight of the mixture is the sum of the weight of chocolate and carob candy, so it is 2 pounds + 55 pounds = 57 pounds.

5. Cost per pound of the mixture:
   To find the cost per pound of the mixture, we divide the total cost by the total weight, so it is $389 / 57 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the cost per pound of the mixture:

$389 / 57 pounds = $6.82 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the cost per pound of the mixture is $6.82.

How many cages did they use ?,"[88,34,6]","[/,-,number0,number1,number2]",9,"[3,4,5,11,12,13,21,22,23,30,31,32]",A pet store had number0 puppies . In one day they sold number1 of them and put the rest into cages with number2 in each cage .,How many cages did they use ?,,[],58,"  #### $8$

If the pet store had $88$ puppies and sold $34$ of them, that means $88 - 34 = 54$ puppies remained. 

To figure out how many cages they used, we need to know how many puppies fit in each cage. The problem states that $6$ puppies fit in each cage.

Since $54$ puppies remained and $6$ fit in each cage, we can divide $54$ puppies by $6$ puppies per cage to find the number of cages needed:

$54 \div 6 = 9$

But the problem asks for the number of cages used, not remaining. Since $34$ puppies were sold, those puppies also needed cages. So we add the number of cages for the puppies sold:

$9 + (\frac{34}{6}) = 9 + 6 = $  $\boxed{8}$ cages"
Paula 's aunt gave her number0 to spend on clothes at the mall . She bought number1 shirts that cost number2 each and a pair of pants that cost number3 .

She bought number1 shirts that cost number2 each and a pair of pants that cost number3 .,How much money does Paula have left to buy more clothes ?,,[],573,"Of course! Let's solve the math problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirts. Since Paula bought 2 shirts that cost $11 each, we can multiply the cost of one shirt by the number of shirts: $11 * 2 = 22.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pants. The pair of pants costs $13.

To find out how much money Paula spent in total, we need to add the cost of the shirts and pants together. So, $22 + $13 = 35.

Now, we can determine how much money Paula has left. Since she initially had $109, we can subtract the total cost of her purchases: $109 - $35 = 74.

So, Paula has $74 left to buy more clothes.

Paige scored 11 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So, we can create an equation based on the information given:

11 (points Paige scored) + 6 (points each for the other players) * (P - 1) (since Paige is one of the players) = 41 (total points).

Now, we can solve for P:

11 + 6(P - 1) = 41

First, we can distribute 6 to both terms inside the parentheses:

11 + 6P - 6 = 41

Next, let's isolate the term with P:

6P = 41 - 11 + 6

Now, perform the arithmetic:

6P = 36

Finally, divide both sides by 6 to find the number of players (P):

P = 36 / 6

P = 6

So, there were 6 players on Paige's team.

Let's represent the initial number of marbles Carla had as ""x"". We can then set up the following equation:

x - 134 = 187

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 134 to both sides:

\[ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\% \]

In this case, the ""Old Value"" is the number of voters in the first year (76 million), and the ""New Value"" is the number of voters in the next year (7 million).

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Calculate the change in the number of voters:
   \[ \text{Change in Voters} = \text{New Value} - \text{Old Value} = 7\,000\,000 - 76\,000\,000 \]

2. Calculate the percentage change:
   \[ \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{Change in Voters}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\% \]

Now, let's calculate it:

Change in Voters: $ 7\,000\,000 - 76\,000\,000 = -69\,000\,000 $

Percentage Change: $ \frac{-69\,000\,000}{76\,000\,000} \times 100\% = -90.789474\% $

So, the percentage change in the number of voters is approximately -90.789474%.

Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as $F$ and the number of people at the second concert as $S$. We know that the total number of people who attended both concerts is 65,899.

So, we can write the equation:
$F + S = 65,899$

We also know that the second concert had 119 more people in attendance than the first concert, so we can write another equation:
$S = F + 119$

Now we can use these two equations to solve for the number of people at the second concert. First, we'll substitute the second equation into the first one:

$F + (F + 119) = 65,899$

Now, we can combine the terms:

$2F + 119 = 65,899$

Subtract 119 from both sides to isolate 2F:

$2F = 65,899 - 119$

$2F = 65,780$

Now, divide by 2 to find the number of people at the first concert, F:

$F = \frac{65,780}{2}$

Now, calculate F:

$F = 32,890$

So, there were 32,890 people at the first concert. To find the number of people at the second concert, use the second equation:

$S = F + 119$

$S = 32,890 + 119$

$S = 33,009$

So, there were 33,009 people at the second concert.

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for $x$:

$5 \cdot 1 = 2x$

$5 = 2x$

To solve for $x$, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

$x = \frac{5}{2}$

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

So, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make 1 loaf of bread.

2. Number of fleas in his left ear: 85
3. Total number of fleas initially found in both ears: 36 (right ear) + 85 (left ear)

Now, we can calculate how many fleas perished:

Total fleas initially found - (Fleas in the right ear + Fleas in the left ear)

So,

36 + 85 = 121

Initial number of fleas - 121 (total in both ears) = Perished fleas

Now, let's calculate the number of perished fleas:

Initial number of toys - 6 (lost) + 9 (found) = 43

Now, we can solve for the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys - 6 + 9 = 43

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

Initial number of toys + 9 = 43 + 6

Initial number of toys + 9 = 49

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to find the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys = 49 - 9

Initial number of toys = 40

So, Blithe initially had 40 toys.

After 7 more passengers got on the bus, the total number of passengers increased by 7 to become ""x + 7"".

Then, 9 passengers got off the bus, which means the total number of passengers decreased by 9 to become ""(x + 7) - 9"".

Finally, we know that in the end there are 26 passengers on the bus, so we can set up the equation:

""(x + 7) - 9 = 26""

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

(x + 7) - 9 = 26
x + 7 - 9 = 26
x - 2 = 26
x = 26 + 2
x = 28

Therefore, there were 28 passengers on the bus initially.

According to the problem, Bruno lost 4 books, so the number of books he had after losing 4 is ""x - 4"". 

After losing 4 books, Bruno's dad gave him 10 more books, so the total number of books he had after his dad gave him the books is ""x - 4 + 10"".

We are given that Bruno had 39 books after his dad gave him the books, so we can set up the equation:

x - 4 + 10 = 39

Simplifying the equation:

x + 6 = 39

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

x = 33

Therefore, Bruno had 33 books at first.

To find the number of children, we can subtract the number of men and women from the total passengers:

Children = Total passengers - Men - Women
Children = 54 - 18 - 26

Calculating this expression:

Children = 54 - 18 - 26
Children = 54 - (18 + 26)

We know that the total number of campers is equal to the sum of soccer campers, basketball campers, and football campers. In this case, the total number of campers is 88.

So we can write the equation:
x + 24 + 32 = 88

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 and 32 from both sides:

x + 24 + 32 - 24 - 32 = 88 - 24 - 32

Simplifying the equation:
x + 56 = 56

Now, to isolate x, we need to subtract 56 from both sides:

x + 56 - 56 = 56 - 56

Simplifying the equation further:
x = 0

So, there were 0 soccer campers.

a pet store had number0 gerbils . if they sold number1 of them how many would they have left ?,"[85,69]","[-,number0,number1]",16,"[3,4,5,9,10,11,16,17,18]",a pet store had number0 gerbils . if they sold number1 of them,how many would they have left ?,,[],2941,"To find out how many gerbils the pet store would have left after selling 69 of them, we need to subtract the number of gerbils sold from the initial number of gerbils.

Initial number of gerbils = 85

To find the number of gerbils left, we subtract the number of gerbils sold from the initial number of gerbils:

$ 85 - 69 = 16 $

Therefore, the pet store would have 16 gerbils left."

The pet store initially had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats is 13 + 5 = 18 cats.

During the sale, they sold 10 cats.

To find out how many cats they have left, we subtract 10 from the initial total of 18:

18 - 10 = 8.

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left.

For every 6 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.

$$
\frac{6 \text{ pounds}}{1 \text{ point}} = \frac{28 \text{ pounds}}{x \text{ points}}
$$

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

$$
6 \cdot x = 28 \cdot 1
$$

$$
6x = 28
$$

To isolate x (the number of points), divide both sides of the equation by 6:

$$
x = \frac{28}{6}
$$

Now, simplify the fraction:

$$
x = 4\frac{2}{6}
$$

To express this as a whole number with a remainder, we can divide 4 by 6:

$$
4 \div 6 = 0 with a remainder of 4
$$

So, the answer is that Chloe and her friends earned 4 points with 2 pounds of paper recycling.

First, let's calculate how much Victor spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck costs 8 dollars and Victor bought 6 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks: $ 8 \times 6 = 48 $.

Next, let's calculate how much Victor's friend spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck also costs 8 dollars and his friend bought 2 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks: $ 8 \times 2 = 16 $.

Now, let's add the amounts spent by Victor and his friend to find the total amount spent: $ 48 + 16 = 64 $.

Therefore, they spent a total of 64 dollars on the trick decks.

Faye scored 28 points, and everyone else scored 8 points each. So, the total number of points scored can be represented as:

$28 + 8P$

We know that the total points scored by the team are 68. So, we can set up the equation:

$28 + 8P = 68$

Now, let's solve for $P$:

Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the term with $P$:

$8P = 68 - 28$

$8P = 40$

To find the number of players on Faye's team ($P$), we need to divide both sides by 8:

$P = \frac{40}{8}$

Now, calculate the value of $P$:

$P = 5$

So, there were 5 players on Faye's team.
