Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is directly proportional to the number of hours it operates. We can represent this relationship as:

Number of gears / Number of hours = Constant

Let's call this constant ""k"". So, we have:

Number of gears / Number of hours = k

Now, we are given that the machine can make 2088 gears in 8 hours. We can substitute these values into our equation:

If each pile had number2 coins in it , how many coins did he have total ?","To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to calculate the number of quarters and dimes separately and then add them together.

Given:
Number of piles of quarters = 5
Number of piles of dimes = 5
Number of coins in each pile = 3

To find the total number of quarters, we can multiply the number of piles of quarters by the number of coins in each pile:

764,"number0 children were riding on the bus . At the bus stop , some more children got on the bus . Then there were number1 children altogether on the bus . How many children got on the bus at the bus stop ?","Let's assume that the number of children who got on the bus at the bus stop is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

Initially, there were 18 children on the bus. When some more children got on the bus at the bus stop, the total number of children on the bus became 25. 

We can represent this situation with an equation: 

18 + x = <<18 + x = 25>> 25

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation, we have: 

x = <<x = 25 - 18>> 25 - 18

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: 

x = <<x = 7>> 7

Therefore, 7 children got on the bus at the bus stop.

If she found number1 treasures on the first level and number2 on the second , what would her score be ?","To find Tiffany's score, we need to calculate the total number of points she earned from finding treasures on both levels.

On the first level, Tiffany found 3 treasures, and each treasure is worth 6 points. So her score from the first level is 3 * 6 = <<3 * 6 = 18>> 18 points.

On the second level, Tiffany found 5 treasures, and each treasure is also worth 6 points. So her score from the second level is 5 * 6 = <<5 * 6 = 30>> 30 points.

To find her total score, we add up the scores from both levels: 18 + 30 = <<18 + 30 = 48>> 48.

Therefore, Tiffany's score would be 48.

1019,ed had number0 more marbles than doug . doug lost number1 of his marbles at the playground . how many more marble did ed have than doug then ?,"Let's start by assigning variables to the unknown quantities in the problem. Let's say that Doug has x marbles.

According to the problem, Ed has 22 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed would have x + 22 marbles.

Next, we are told that Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, Doug would have x - 8 marbles remaining.

To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles, we subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has:

(x + 22) - (x - 8)

Simplifying this expression:

x + 22 - x + 8

The x terms cancel each other out:

22 + 8

Adding these numbers together:

30

Therefore, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug after Doug lost 8 of his marbles.

1020,annette and caitlin weigh number0 pounds together . caitlin and sara weigh number1 pounds together . how much more does annette weigh than sara ?,"Let's assume that Annette weighs A pounds, Caitlin weighs C pounds, and Sara weighs S pounds.

According to the given information, we know that:

1. Annette and Caitlin weigh 95 pounds together: A + C = 95
2. Caitlin and Sara weigh 87 pounds together: C + S = 87

To find out how much more Annette weighs than Sara, we need to calculate the difference between their weights (A - S).

To do this, we can substitute the value of C from equation 2 into equation 1:

A + (87 - S) = 95

Simplifying the equation:

A + 87 - S = 95
A - S = 8

Therefore, Annette weighs 8 pounds more than Sara.

Initially, Maura had 75 seashells. After giving some to her sister, she had 57 seashells left.

We can represent this situation with the equation:

75 - x = <<75 - x = 57>> 57

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation.

Subtracting 57 from both sides of the equation:

75 - x - 57 = <<75 - x - 57 = 57 - 57>> 57 - 57

Simplifying:

18 - x = <<18 - x = 0>> 0

To isolate x, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

18 - x - 18 = <<18 - x - 18 = 0 - 18>> 0 - 18

Simplifying:

-x = <<-x = -18>> -18

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

-1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-18)>> -1 * (-18)

Simplifying:

x = <<x = 18>> 18

Therefore, Maura gave her little sister 18 seashells.

Given that the tallest giraffe at the zoo is 96 inches tall (T = <<T = 96>> 96) and the shortest giraffe is 68 inches tall (S = <<S = 68>> 68), we can calculate the height difference by subtracting <<S>> from <<T>>:

T - S = <<T - S = 96 - 68>> 96 - 68

Calculating this expression:

96 - 68 = <<96 - 68 = 28>> 28

Therefore, the taller giraffe is 28 inches taller than the shorter giraffe.

According to the problem, JT lost 14 cards, so we subtract 14 from x: <<x - 14>>.

Then, he gave 19 cards to his best friend, so we subtract another 19 from the previous result: <<(x - 14) - 19>>.

Finally, we know that after losing some and giving some away, JT has 45 cards left. So we set up an equation: (x - 14) - 19 = <<(x - 14) - 19 = 45>> 45.

To find the value of x, we can simplify the equation: x - 33 = <<x - 33 = 45>> 45.

1282,vanessa uploaded number0 pictures from her phone and number1 from her camera to facebook . if she sorted the pics into number2 different albums with the same amount of pics in each album how many pictures were in each of the albums ?,"To find out how many pictures were in each album, we can divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

The total number of pictures is the sum of the pictures uploaded from Vanessa's phone and camera: 23 + 7 = 30.

Let's denote the number of pictures in each album as ""x"".

We can set up an equation to represent this situation: x * 5 = 30.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

(x * 5) / 5 = 30 / 5.

Simplifying, we have:

x = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 pictures in each album.

Initial amount of money = <<63
Amount spent on a new game = >>48

To calculate the money left, we subtract the amount spent from the initial amount:
<<63 - >>48 = <<15

Now, we can determine how many 3-dollar toys Roger can buy with the remaining >>15. We divide the remaining money by the cost of each toy:

<<15 / >>3 = 5

1291,a new building needed number0 windows . the builder had already installed number1 of them . if it takes number2 hours to install each window how long will it take him to install the rest ?,"To find out how long it will take the builder to install the remaining windows, we need to determine how many windows are left to be installed and then calculate the total time required.

The number of windows left to be installed can be found by subtracting the number of windows already installed from the total number of windows needed. In this case, the total number of windows needed is 14 and the number of windows already installed is 5. So, the number of windows left to be installed is:

14 - 5 = <<14 - 5 = 9>> 9

Now, we can calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows. Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by 4:

9 * 4 = <<9 * 4 = 36>> 36

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.
