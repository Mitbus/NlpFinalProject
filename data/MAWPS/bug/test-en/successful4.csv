0,every day ryan spends number0 hours on learning english and number1 hours on learning chinese . if he learns for number2 days how many hours does he spend on learning english and chinese in all ?,"To find out how many hours Ryan spends on learning English and Chinese in total, we need to calculate the total number of hours he spends on each subject separately and then add them together.

Ryan spends 6 hours per day on learning English and 7 hours per day on learning Chinese. To find the total number of hours he spends on learning English over 5 days, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days:

6 * 5 = <<6 * 5 = 30>> 30

Similarly, to find the total number of hours he spends on learning Chinese over 5 days, we can multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days:

7 * 5 = <<7 * 5 = 35>> 35

Finally, to find the total number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese in all, we add the two totals together:

30 + 35 = <<30 + 35 = 65>> 65

Therefore, Ryan spends a total of 65 hours on learning English and Chinese over 5 days.

3,jake has number0 fewer peaches and number1 more apples than steven . steven has number2 peaches and number3 apples . how many apples does jake have ?,"Let's start by finding out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 13 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 9 peaches. To find the number of peaches Jake has, we subtract 13 from Steven's number of peaches.

 9 - 13 = << 9 - 13 = -4 >> -4 

Since it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of peaches, we can conclude that Jake does not have any peaches.

Next, let's determine how many apples Jake has. We are told that Jake has 3 more apples than Steven, who has 8 apples. To find the number of apples Jake has, we add 3 to Steven's number of apples.

 8 + 3 = << 8 + 3 = 11 >> 11 

Therefore, Jake has 11 apples.

16,paul had number0 books and number1 pens . after selling some books and pens in a garage sale he had number2 books and number3 pens left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 108 books and after selling x books, he had 66 books left. This can be represented as:

108 - x = <<108 - x = 66>> 66

To find the value of x, we can subtract 66 from both sides of the equation:

108 - x - 66 = <<108 - x - 66 = 66 - 66>> 66 - 66

Simplifying the equation gives us:

42 - x = <<42 - x = 0>> 0

To isolate x, we can subtract 42 from both sides of the equation:

42 - x - 42 = <<42 - x - 42 = 0 - 42>> 0 - 42

Simplifying further gives us:

-x = <<-x = -42>> -42

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

-1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-42)>> -1 * (-42)

This simplifies to:

x = <<x = 42>> 42

Therefore, Paul sold 42 books in the garage sale.

27,number0 birds and number1 storks were sitting on the fence . number2 more storks came to join them . how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence ?,"To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, we first need to determine the total number of birds and storks on the fence. 

Given that there are 6 birds and 3 storks initially sitting on the fence, we can calculate the total number of birds and storks by adding these two quantities together:

6 + 3 = <<6 + 3 = 9>> 9

So, initially, there are a total of 9 birds and storks on the fence. 

Next, we need to consider the additional 2 storks that came to join them. To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence now, we need to subtract the number of storks from the number of birds.

Since there were initially 6 birds and now there are still 6 birds (no additional birds joined), we can subtract the number of storks from this quantity:

6 - (3 + 2) = <<6 - (3 + 2) = 6 - 5 = 1>> 6 - 5 = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 more bird than stork sitting on the fence now.

28,david did number0 push-ups in gym class today . david did number1 more push-ups than zachary . how many push-ups did zachary and david do altogether ?,"Let's assume the number of push-ups Zachary did is represented by the variable << Z >>. 

According to the information given, David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, the number of push-ups David did can be represented as << Z + 49 >>. 

We are also told that David did a total of 51 push-ups. So we can set up an equation: 

 Z + 49 = << Z + 49 = 51 >> 51 

To find the value of << Z >>, we can subtract 49 from both sides of the equation: 

 Z = << Z = 51 - 49 >> 51 - 49 

Simplifying the right side gives us: 

 Z = << Z = 2 >> 2 

So Zachary did 2 push-ups. 

To find out how many push-ups Zachary and David did altogether, we can add their individual totals: 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 2 + (2 + 49) >> 2 + (2 + 49) 

Simplifying this expression gives us: 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 2 + 51 >> 2 + 51 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 53 >> 53 

Therefore, Zachary and David did a total of 53 push-ups altogether.

The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given that Jesse's rooms are 19 feet long and 18 feet wide, the area of one room can be calculated as follows:

Area of one room = Length × Width
                  = 19 feet × 18 feet
                  = 342 square feet

Since Jesse has 20 rooms in total, we can now calculate the total amount of carpet she needs by multiplying the area of one room by the number of rooms:

Total carpet needed = Area of one room × Number of rooms
                   = 342 square feet × 20 rooms
                   = 6840 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs 6840 square feet of carpet to cover the floors of all her rooms.

Number of books = 23
Number of magazines = 61
Number of bookshelves = 29

To find the total number of books, we multiply the number of books per shelf by the number of shelves:
Total number of books = Number of books per shelf * Number of shelves
Total number of books = 23 * 29

To find the total number of magazines, we multiply the number of magazines per shelf by the number of shelves:
Total number of magazines = Number of magazines per shelf * Number of shelves
Total number of magazines = 61 * 29

To find the total number of books and magazines, we add the total number of books and the total number of magazines:
Total number of books and magazines = Total number of books + Total number of magazines

Calculating each step:

Total number of books = 23 * 29
Total number of books = 667

Total number of magazines = 61 * 29
Total number of magazines = 1769

Total number of books and magazines = 667 + 1769
