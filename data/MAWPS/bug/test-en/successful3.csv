0,bobby had number0 pieces of candy . he ate number1 pieces of candy . then he ate number2 more . how many pieces of candy does he still have left ?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby has left, we need to subtract the number of pieces he ate from the total number of pieces he had initially.

Bobby initially had 21 pieces of candy.
He ate 5 pieces of candy.
So, the number of pieces he had left after eating 5 pieces is 21 - 5.

Next, Bobby ate 9 more pieces of candy.
To find out how many pieces he had left after eating 9 more, we subtract 9 from the previous result.

Therefore, the number of pieces of candy Bobby has left is (21 - 5) - 9.

Calculating this expression, we get (21 - 5) - 9 = 16 - 9 = 7.

So, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.

9,jerry had number0 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added number1 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones . if there are number2 action figures on his shelf now how many action figures did he remove from the shelf ?,"Let's assume that Jerry removed x action figures from the shelf.

Initially, Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf.
He then added 4 more action figures, resulting in a total of 3 + 4 = 7 action figures on the shelf.
After removing some action figures, there are now 6 action figures on the shelf.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 - x = 6.

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
7 - x - 6 = 6 - 6,
which simplifies to:
1 - x = 0.

To isolate x, we can subtract 1 from both sides of the equation:
1 - x - 1 = 0 - 1,
which simplifies to:
-x = -1.

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:
-x * (-1) = -1 * (-1),
which simplifies to:
x = 1.

Therefore, Jerry removed 1 action figure from the shelf.

13,number0 birds and number1 storks were sitting on the fence . number2 more storks came to join them . how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence ?,"To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to determine the difference between the number of storks and the number of birds.

Given that there are 4 birds and 3 storks initially sitting on the fence, we can represent this as:
Number of birds = 4
Number of storks = 3

Next, we are told that 6 more storks came to join them. To find the total number of storks, we can add the initial number of storks to the additional storks:
Total number of storks = Number of storks + Additional storks = 3 + 6 = 9

Now, we can calculate the difference between the total number of storks and the number of birds to find how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence:
Difference = Total number of storks - Number of birds = 9 - 4 = 5

Therefore, there are 5 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

16,a book has number0 chapters . each chapter is number1 pages long . how many pages does the book have altogether ?,"To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to multiply the number of chapters by the number of pages in each chapter.

Let's denote the number of chapters as <<C>> and the number of pages in each chapter as <<P>>.

Given that the book has 31 chapters and each chapter is 61 pages long, we have:

C = <<C = 31>> 31 and P = <<P = 61>> 61

To find the total number of pages, we can use the formula:

Total number of pages = Number of chapters <<*>> Number of pages in each chapter

Total = <<Total = C * P>> C * P

Substituting the given values, we have:

Total = <<Total = 31 * 61>> 31 * 61

We know that the book has 2 chapters across 81 pages, and the second chapter is 68 pages long. 

We can set up an equation to represent this information: 

81 = <<81 = x + 68>> x + 68

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 68 from both sides of the equation: 

81 - 68 = <<81 - 68 = x>> x

Simplifying the left side of the equation gives us: 

13 = <<13 = x>> x

Therefore, there are 13 pages in the second chapter.

According to the problem, 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon. So, the total number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon is 7.

The total number of campers who went rowing that day is given as 60.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = <<x + 7 = 60>> 60

To solve for <<x>>, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 60 - 7>> 60 - 7

x = <<x = 53>> 53

Therefore, 53 campers went rowing in the morning.

22,rachel picked number0 apples from her tree . thereafter number1 new apples grew on the tree . now the tree has number2 apples still on it . how many apples did the tree have to begin with ?,"Let's denote the number of apples the tree had to begin with as ""x"". 

According to the information given, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree, so the number of apples remaining on the tree is ""x - 7"". 

Afterward, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so the number of apples on the tree became ""(x - 7) + 2"". 

Finally, it is stated that the tree now has 6 apples still on it, so we can set up the equation: 

""(x - 7) + 2 = 6"". 

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: 

""x - 7 + 2 = 6"", 

which can be further simplified to: 

""x - 5 = 6"". 

To isolate x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation: 

""x - 5 + 5 = 6 + 5"", 

which simplifies to: 

""x = 11"". 

Therefore, the tree had 11 apples to begin with.

23,rachel has number0 apples trees . she picked number1 apples from each of her trees . now the trees have a total number2 apples still on them . how many apples were there on all trees initially ?,"Let's denote the number of apples on each tree initially as <<x>>. Since Rachel has 3 apple trees, the total number of apples on all trees initially can be calculated by multiplying the number of apples on each tree by the number of trees, which is <<3x>>. 

Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree, so the total number of apples she picked is 3 * 8 = <<3 * 8 = 24>> 24. 

After picking the apples, there were 9 apples still on the trees. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3x - 24 = <<3x - 24 = 9>> 9 to represent the situation. 

To find the initial number of apples on all trees, we need to solve this equation for <<x>>. 

Adding 24 to both sides of the equation, we get 3x = <<3x = 33>> 33. 

Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find that x = <<x = 11>> 11. 

Therefore, there were initially 11 apples on each tree, and the total number of apples on all trees was 3 * 11 = <<3 * 11 = 33>> 33.

According to the given information, Ed had 6 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 6 marbles.

If Doug lost 7 marbles at the playground, he would have x - 7 marbles left.

We are also given that Ed had 22 marbles, so we can set up the equation:

x + 6 = 22

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

x = 22 - 6

Simplifying the right side:

x = 16

Therefore, Doug initially had 16 marbles.

Now, to find out how many marbles Doug has after losing 7, we can subtract 7 from his initial number of marbles:

After losing some marbles at the playground, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed currently has x + 8 marbles.
To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to find the difference between the number of marbles Ed had initially and the number of marbles Ed currently has.
The calculation can be represented as (x + 19) - (x + 8).
Simplifying the expression, we get x + 19 - x - 8.
Combining like terms, we have 19 - 8.
Calculating the difference, we find that Ed lost 11 marbles.

According to the problem, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes, which is 63 more than the number of students who suggested bacon. 

So, we can set up the equation 457 = <<457 = x + 63>> x + 63 to represent this relationship. 

To solve for <<x>>, we can subtract 63 from both sides of the equation: 

457 - 63 = <<457 - 63 = x + 63 - 63>> x + 63 - 63

Simplifying the equation gives us:

27,because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . number0 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu . if number1 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes how many students suggested bacon ?,"Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is represented by the variable <<m>>. 

According to the problem, 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. So we can write the equation m = <<m = 182>> 182.

It is also given that the number of students who suggested adding bacon is 166 more than those who suggested mashed potatoes. We can represent this as b = <<b = m + 166>> m + 166.

To find the number of students who suggested bacon, we need to substitute the value of <<m>> from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting m = <<m = 182>> 182 into b = <<b = m + 166>> m + 166, we get b = <<b = 182 + 166>> 182 + 166.

Zachary did 58 push-ups and 33 crunches. 

David did 36 more push-ups than Zachary, so we can calculate the number of push-ups David did by adding 36 to Zachary's push-ups: 58 + 36 = <<58 + 36 = 94>> 94.

David also did 33 less crunches than Zachary, so we can calculate the number of crunches David did by subtracting 33 from Zachary's crunches: 33 - 33 = <<33 - 33 = 0>> 0.

Now we can calculate the difference between the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did by subtracting the number of crunches from the number of push-ups: 58 - 33 = <<58 - 33 = 25>> 25.

Therefore, Zachary did 25 more push-ups than crunches.

33,paul had number0 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought number1 new ones . if he has number2 books now how many more books did he buy than he sold ?,"Sure, let's solve the math problem step by step.

Let's assume that Paul initially sold ""x"" books in the garage sale.

So, after selling ""x"" books, the number of books Paul had was 71 - x.

Then, he bought 38 new books, which means the total number of books he had became (71 - x) + 38.

According to the problem, the total number of books Paul has now is 116. So we can set up the equation:

(71 - x) + 38 = 116

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of ""x"".

Combining like terms, we have:

71 - x + 38 = 116

Adding the numbers on the left side, we get:

109 - x = 116

To isolate ""x"", we subtract 109 from both sides:

- x = 116 - 109

Simplifying, we have:

- x = 7

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides by -1:

x = -7

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of books Paul bought and the number of books he sold. 

The number of books he bought is 38.

The number of books he sold is -7 (since he sold more books than he bought).

To find the difference, we calculate:

38 - (-7)

Simplifying, we have:

38 + 7 = 45

So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.

Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, which means the number of roses decreased by 4. After that, she cut some more roses from her garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 23 roses in the vase.

So, we can set up the equation: 

2 - 4 + x = 23

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation.

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

-2 + x = 23

Next, let's isolate x by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

-2 + x + 2 = 23 + 2

35,dave had number0 apps and number1 files on his phone . after deleting some apps and files he had number2 files and number3 apps left . how many more apps than files does he have left on the phone ?,"Let's start by finding out how many apps and files Dave deleted from his phone. We can do this by subtracting the number of remaining apps and files from the initial number of apps and files.

Initial number of apps = 24
Remaining number of apps = 12

Initial number of files = 9
Remaining number of files = 5

To find the number of deleted apps, we subtract the remaining number of apps from the initial number of apps:
Deleted apps = Initial number of apps - Remaining number of apps = 24 - 12 = 12

To find the number of deleted files, we subtract the remaining number of files from the initial number of files:
Deleted files = Initial number of files - Remaining number of files = 9 - 5 = 4

Now, let's calculate how many more apps than files Dave has left on his phone. We can do this by subtracting the remaining number of files from the remaining number of apps:

More apps than files = Remaining number of apps - Remaining number of files = 12 - 5 = 7

Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.

37,josh had number0 marbles in his collection . he lost number1 marbles and found number2 new ones . how many more marbles did he lose than those he found ?,"To find the number of marbles Josh lost more than those he found, we need to subtract the number of marbles he found from the number of marbles he lost.

Given that Josh had 4 marbles in his collection, lost 16 marbles, and found 8 new ones, we can calculate the difference as follows:

Number of marbles lost = 16
Number of marbles found = 8

To find the difference, we subtract the number of marbles found from the number of marbles lost:

 16 - 8 = << 16 - 8 = 8 >> 8 

Therefore, Josh lost 8 more marbles than the ones he found.

38,number0 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop number1 children got on the bus while some got off the bus . then there were number2 children altogether on the bus . how many children got off the bus at the bus stop ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 22 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus.
3. Let's assume that x children got off the bus at the bus stop.
4. After some children got off, there were 2 children left on the bus.
5. Therefore, we can write the equation: 22 + 40 - x = 2.

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation:

22 + 40 - x = 2
62 - x = 2
-x = 2 - 62
-x = -60

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-60)
x = 60

Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

39,baker made number0 cakes and number1 pastries . if he sold number2 cakes and number3 pastries how many cakes would baker still have ?,"To find out how many cakes Baker would still have, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the total number of cakes he had initially.

The total number of cakes Baker had initially is given as 149 cakes. 

Baker sold 10 cakes, so we subtract 10 from the initial number of cakes:
 149 - 10 = << 149 - 10 = 139 >> 139 

Therefore, Baker would still have 139 cakes. 

#### 139"
40,baker made number0 cakes and number1 pastries . if he sold number2 pastries and number3 cakes how many more cakes than pastries did baker sell ?,"To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold.

Given:
Number of cakes made = 14
Number of pastries made = 153
Number of pastries sold = 8
Number of cakes sold = 97

To calculate the difference between the number of cakes and pastries sold, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold:

Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold = Difference

97 - 8 = Difference

Calculating the difference:

97 - 8 = <<97 - 8 = 89>> 89

Therefore, Baker sold 89 more cakes than pastries.

The number of sacks of ripe oranges harvested per day is 82.

So, the total number of sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days can be calculated as:

 82 * 25 = << 82 * 25 = 2050 >> 2050 

Therefore, they will have 2050 sacks of ripe oranges after 25 days of harvest.

42,jesse needs a carpet of size number0 square feet to cover her room . if her room is number1 feet wide what is the length of her room ?,"To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 

Area = Length × Width

We know that the area of the room is 10 square feet and the width is 2 feet. Let's substitute these values into the formula:

10 = Length × 2

To solve for the length, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

10/2 = Length × 2/2

Simplifying:

5 = Length

Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.

43,they decided to hold the party in their backyard . they have number0 chairs for each set of table . if they have number1 sets of tables how many more chairs than tables do they have ?,"To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we need to calculate the difference between the total number of chairs and the total number of tables.

The total number of chairs can be found by multiplying the number of chairs per set of table (14) by the number of sets of tables (9):

 14 * 9 = << 14 * 9 = 126 >> 126 

The total number of tables is simply given as 9.

To find the difference, we subtract the total number of tables from the total number of chairs:

 126 - 9 = << 126 - 9 = 117 >> 117 

Therefore, they have 117 more chairs than tables.

44,melissa scored number0 points in each game . she also got number1 bonus points in each game . how many points did she score in number2 games ?,"To find out how many points Melissa scored in 79 games, we need to calculate the total number of points she scored in one game and then multiply it by the number of games.

Melissa scored 109 points in each game and received an additional 82 bonus points. So, the total number of points she scored in one game is 109 + 82 = <<109 + 82 = 191>> 191.

To find out how many points she scored in 79 games, we can multiply the total number of points per game by the number of games: 191 * 79 = <<191 * 79 = 15089>> 15089.

Therefore, Melissa scored a total of 15,089 points in 79 games.

45,in haley 's class number0 are boys who love to play marbles . if haley gives number1 marbles to each boy how many marbles did she have ?,"Let's denote the number of boys in Haley's class as ""b"". According to the given information, there are 11 boys who love to play marbles. Therefore, we can write the equation:

b = 11

Haley gives 9 marbles to each boy. So, the total number of marbles she gives away is:

9 * b

To find out how many marbles Haley had initially, we need to subtract the number of marbles she gave away from her initial total. Let's denote the initial number of marbles as ""m"". The equation becomes:

m - (9 * b)

Since we want to find the value of ""m"", we can set it equal to zero and solve for ""m"":

m - (9 * b) = 0

Now, let's substitute the value of ""b"" from the first equation into the second equation:

m - (9 * 11) = 0

Simplifying this equation gives us:

m - 99 = 0

To isolate ""m"", we add 99 to both sides of the equation:

m = 99

Therefore, Haley initially had 99 marbles.

46,each pack of dvds costs number0 dollars . if there is a discount of number1 dollars on each pack how many packs of dvds can you buy with number2 dollars ?,"To find out how many packs of DVDs can be bought with <<93, we need to consider the cost of each pack and the discount applied.

Each pack of DVDs costs >>107, and there is a discount of 106 on each pack. This means that the effective cost per pack after the discount is >>107 - <<106 = <<106 on each pack. This means that the effective cost per pack after the discount is >>107 - <<106 = >> 1.

To determine how many packs can be bought with <<93, we divide the total amount available by the cost per pack:

>>93 / <<1 = 93

Therefore, with >>93, you can buy 93 packs of DVDs.

47,after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that number0 visitors came to the buckingham palace that day . if number1 people visited the buckingham palace within the past number2 days how many visitors visited the buckingham palace on the previous day ?,"To find the number of visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day, we can use the given information.

Let's assume that the number of visitors on the previous day is represented by ""x"".

We know that 132 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the current day and that a total of 406 people visited the palace within the past 327 days.

So, if we subtract 132 from 406 (the total number of visitors in the past 327 days), we will get the number of visitors who visited on all other days except for the current day.

This can be represented as:

 x = << x = 406 - 132 >> 406 - 132 

Simplifying this equation:

 x = << x = 274 >> 274 

Therefore, there were 274 visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.

48,jessie weighed number0 kilograms . after she started to go jogging everyday she lost number1 kilograms in the first week and number2 kilograms in the second week . how much does she weigh now ?,"To find out how much Jessie weighs now, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her initial weight.

First, let's calculate the total weight Jessie lost in the first two weeks:
In the first week, she lost 50 kilograms.
In the second week, she lost an additional 60 kilograms.
Therefore, the total weight she lost is 50 + 60 = <<50 + 60 = 110>> 110 kilograms.

Now, we can find out how much Jessie weighs now by subtracting the total weight she lost from her initial weight:
Initial weight = 114 kilograms
Total weight lost = 110 kilograms

Weight now = Initial weight - Total weight lost
Weight now = <<114 - 110>>

49,jessie currently weighs number0 kilograms . after she started to go jogging everyday she lost number1 kilograms in the first week and number2 kilograms in the second week . how much did she weigh before starting to jog ?,"To find out how much Jessie weighed before starting to jog, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her current weight.

Given:
Current weight = 9 kilograms
Weight lost in the first week = 62 kilograms
Weight lost in the second week = 140 kilograms

To calculate her previous weight, we subtract the weight lost from her current weight:

Previous weight = Current weight + Weight lost in the first week + Weight lost in the second week

Let's plug in the values and calculate:

Previous weight = 9 + 62 + 140

Previous weight = 211

Therefore, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before she started jogging.
