1,jake has number0 fewer peaches than steven who has number1 more peaches than jill . steven has number2 peaches . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's assume that the number of peaches Jake has is represented by the variable <<J>>, the number of peaches Steven has is represented by the variable <<S>>, and the number of peaches Jill has is represented by the variable <<Jill>>.

According to the given information, we know that Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, so we can write an equation as:

S = <<S = Jill + 14>> Jill + 14

We also know that Steven has 15 peaches, so we can substitute <<S>> with 15 in the equation:

15 = <<15 = Jill + 14>> Jill + 14

To find out how many peaches Jill has, we need to solve this equation. Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

15 - 14 = <<15 - 14 = Jill>> Jill

Simplifying the left side gives us:

1 = <<1 = Jill>> Jill

So, Jill has 1 peach.

Now, we know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. We can represent this relationship with another equation:

J = <<J = S - 7>> S - 7

Substituting <<S>> with 15 (since Steven has 15 peaches) in the equation gives us:

J = <<J = 15 - 7>> 15 - 7

Simplifying the right side gives us:

J = <<J = 8>> 8

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.

Let's set up the equation:

<<104 / 26 = x>>

Now, we can solve for x by performing the division:

<<104 / 26 = 4>>

Therefore, you can buy 4 packs of DVDs with >>104.

3,a farmer had number0 tomatoes in his garden . if he picked number1 of them yesterday and number2 today . how many will he have left after today ?,"To find out how many tomatoes the farmer will have left after today, we need to subtract the number of tomatoes he picked today from the total number of tomatoes he had before.

The farmer initially had 171 tomatoes in his garden.
He picked 134 of them yesterday.
Therefore, the number of tomatoes he had before today is 171 - 134 = <<171 - 134 = 37>> 37.

Today, he picked an additional 30 tomatoes.
To find out how many tomatoes he will have left after today, we subtract this number from the previous result: 37 - 30 = <<37 - 30 = 7>> 7.

Therefore, the farmer will have 7 tomatoes left after today.

4,for the walls of the house he would use number0 large planks of wood . if each plank of wood needs number1 pieces of nails to be secured and in addition he needs number2 nails are needed for some smaller planks . how many nails does john need for the house wall ?,"To find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the number of nails required for the large planks and the smaller planks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. Since each plank requires 17 nails, and John is using 13 large planks, we can multiply these two values together:

 17 * 13 = << 17 * 13 = 221 >> 221 

So, John needs 221 nails for the large planks.

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the smaller planks. We are given that he needs an additional 8 nails for these smaller planks.

Therefore, the total number of nails needed for the house wall is:

 221 + 8 = << 221 + 8 = 229 >> 229 

Hence, John needs 229 nails for the house wall.

5,allan brought number0 balloons and jake brought number1 balloons to the park . jake then bought number2 more balloons at the park . how many more balloons did allan have than jake in the park ?,"Allan brought 6 balloons to the park and Jake brought 2 balloons. Jake then bought 3 more balloons at the park. To find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake in the park, we need to calculate the difference between the number of balloons each person has.

Allan initially had 6 balloons, and Jake initially had 2 balloons. After Jake bought 3 more balloons, he would have a total of 2 + 3 = <<2 + 3 = 5>> 5 balloons.

To find the difference between the number of balloons Allan and Jake have, we subtract the number of balloons Jake has from the number of balloons Allan has: 6 - 5 = <<6 - 5 = 1>> 1.

Therefore, Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.

11,after resting they decided to go for a swim . the depth of the water is number0 times dean 's height . dean is number1 feet shorter than ron . if ron stands at number2 feet how deep was the water ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. The depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height.
2. Dean is 8 feet shorter than Ron.
3. Ron stands at 14 feet.

To find out how deep the water is, we need to determine Dean's height first.

Let's assume Dean's height as ""D"" feet. According to the given information, Ron's height would be ""D + 8"" feet.

Since the depth of the water is 2 times Dean's height, we can calculate it as ""2D"" feet.

Now, we know that Ron stands at 14 feet, so we can set up an equation:

""D + 8 = 14""

Solving this equation will give us Dean's height (D).

""D = 14 - 8""

Calculating this equation gives us:

""D = 6""

Now that we know Dean's height is 6 feet, we can find the depth of the water by multiplying it by 2:

""2D = 2 * 6""

Calculating this equation gives us:

""2D = 12""

Therefore, the depth of the water is 12 feet.

Number of groups: 140
Size of each group: 187

To calculate the total number of bananas, we can use the formula:

Total number of bananas = Number of groups * Size of each group

Plugging in the values:

Total number of bananas = 140 * 187

Calculating this expression:

 140 * 187 = << 140 * 187 = 26180 >> 26180 

Therefore, Philip has 26,180 bananas in his collection.
