1,number0 red peaches and number1 green peaches are in the basket . how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket ?,"To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches.

Let's denote the number of red peaches as R and the number of green peaches as G.

We are given that there are 5 red peaches, so R = 5.
We are also given that there are 11 green peaches, so G = 11.

To find the difference between the number of green peaches and red peaches, we subtract R from G: G - R.

Substituting the values, we have 11 - 5 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket.

2,number0 red peaches and some more green peaches are in the basket . if there are a total of number1 peaches in the basket how many green peaches are in the basket ?,"Let's assume the number of green peaches in the basket is represented by the variable << g >>. We are given that there are 10 red peaches, so the total number of peaches can be expressed as << 10 + g >>. 

According to the problem, the total number of peaches in the basket is 15. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

 10 + g = << 10 + g = 15 >> 15 

To find the value of << g >>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

 g = << g = 15 - 10 >> 15 - 10 

Simplifying the right side gives us:

 g = << g = 5 >> 5 

Hence, there are 5 green peaches in the basket.

3,there are number0 peaches distributed equally in some baskets . if each basket has number1 red peaches and number2 green peaches how many baskets of peaches are there ?,"To find the number of baskets of peaches, we need to divide the total number of peaches by the number of peaches in each basket.

Given that each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches, there are a total of 4 + 6 = 10 peaches in each basket.

Let's denote the number of baskets as ""x"". Therefore, the total number of peaches can be calculated as x * (4 + 6) = 10x.

Since we know that there are a total of 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets, we can set up the equation:

10x = 10

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

10x/10 = 10/10

This simplifies to:

x = 1

Therefore, there is only one basket of peaches.

4,jerry had some action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added number0 more action figures to the shelf . if there are a total of number1 action figures on his shelf now how many action figures did he have initially on the shelf ?,"Let's assume that Jerry initially had x action figures on the shelf.

He then added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures on the shelf is x + 7.

We are given that there are a total of 10 action figures on his shelf now, so we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = 10

To find the value of x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7

x = 3

Therefore, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.

5,ed had number0 more marbles than doug . doug lost number1 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had number2 marbles how many more marbles did ed have than doug then ?,"Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the given information.

Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. According to the problem, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 10) marbles.

Next, we are told that Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. After losing these marbles, Doug would have (x - 11) marbles.

We are also given that Ed had 45 marbles. So we can set up the equation:

(x + 10) = 45

Now, let's solve for x to find out how many marbles Doug initially had:

x + 10 = 45
Subtracting 10 from both sides:
x = 35

Therefore, Doug initially had 35 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can substitute the value of x into our equation:

(x + 10) - (x - 11)

Simplifying this expression:
x + 10 - x + 11
Combining like terms:
21

So, Ed had 21 more marbles than Doug.

6,because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . if number0 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while number1 suggested adding bacon to the menu how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon ?,"To find out how many more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon, we need to subtract the number of students who suggested bacon from the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes.

Let's denote the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes as ""m"" and the number of students who suggested bacon as ""b"".

According to the given information, we know that m = 408 (students suggested adding mashed potatoes) and b = 42 (students suggested adding bacon).

To find the difference between the two, we can subtract b from m:

m - b = 408 - 42

Calculating this expression:

408 - 42 = 366

Therefore, 366 more students suggested mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon.

7,edward had number0 . he spent some money . now he has number1 . how much money did edward spend ?,"Let's assume Edward spent <<x. 

Initially, Edward had >>13. After spending some money, he now has <<3. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

>>13 - x = 3 

To find the value of x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 

<<13 - x - 3 = 3 - 3 

Simplifying the equation: 

>>10 - x = 0 

To isolate x, we can subtract <<10 from both sides of the equation: 

>>10 - x - 10 = <<10 = 0 - >> 0 - 10 

Simplifying the equation: 

-x = -<<10 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1: 

-x * -1 = ->>10 * -1 

Simplifying the equation: 

x = <<10 

Therefore, Edward spent >>10.

8,david did number0 push-ups in gym class today . david did number1 more push-ups than zachary . how many push-ups did zachary do ?,"Let's assume the number of push-ups Zachary did is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, David did 9 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, David did <<x + 9>> push-ups.

The total number of push-ups David did is stated as 44. So we can set up the equation:

x + 9 = <<x + 9 = 44>> 44

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 9 from both sides:

x = <<x = 44 - 9>> 44 - 9

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 35>> 35

Therefore, Zachary did 35 push-ups.

#### 35"
9,zachary did number0 push-ups and number1 crunches in gym class today . david did number2 more push-ups but number3 less crunches than zachary . how many crunches did david do ?,"Let's start by finding out how many push-ups David did. We know that Zachary did 44 push-ups, and David did 29 more push-ups than Zachary. So, we can calculate the number of push-ups David did by adding 29 to the number of push-ups Zachary did: 

 44 + 29 = << 44 + 29 = 73 >> 73 

Next, let's find out how many crunches David did. We know that Zachary did 17 crunches, and David did 13 less crunches than Zachary. So, we can calculate the number of crunches David did by subtracting 13 from the number of crunches Zachary did:

 17 - 13 = << 17 - 13 = 4 >> 4 

Therefore, David did 4 crunches.

14,the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped number0 inches . the frog jumped number1 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped number2 inches farther than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's denote the distance jumped by the grasshopper as <<G>>. According to the problem, the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can represent the distance jumped by the frog as <<G + 10>>. Similarly, the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so we can represent the distance jumped by the mouse as <<(G + 10) + 20>>.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their distances. So, we subtract <<G>> from <<(G + 10) + 20>>.

<<((G + 10) + 20) - G>>

Simplifying this expression:

<<(G + 30) - G>>

The <<G>> terms cancel out:

15,the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped number0 inches . the mouse jumped number1 inches lesser than the frog who jumped number2 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.
- The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.
- The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their jumps. 

Let's denote the distance jumped by the mouse as M>> and the distance jumped by the frog as <<F>>. We already know that <<F = <<M>> and the distance jumped by the frog as <<F>>. We already know that <<F = G + 37>> G + 37, where <<G>> represents the distance jumped by the grasshopper.

We also know that M = <<M = F - 16>> F - 16, as the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

Substituting the value of <<F>> from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

M = <<M = (G + 37) - 16>> (G + 37) - 16

Simplifying this expression, we have:

M = <<M = G + 21>> G + 21

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

23,paul had number0 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought number1 new ones . if he has number2 books now how many books did he sell ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 2 books.
After selling some in the garage sale, he bought 150 new ones.
So, the total number of books he had after the garage sale is 2 + 150 = 152.

Now, we are given that Paul currently has 58 books.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: 152 - x = 58.

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation:
152 - x = 58
Subtracting 152 from both sides:
152 - x - 152 = 58 - 152
Simplifying:
-x = -94
Dividing both sides by -1 (to isolate x):
x = 94

Therefore, Paul sold 94 books in the garage sale.

Let's denote the amount of hair Robin cut as ""x"". 

The initial length of Robin's hair was 17 inches, and after cutting off some inches, it became 13 inches. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

17 - x = <<17 - x = 13>> 13

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 13 from both sides of the equation:

17 - 13 = <<17 - 13 = x>> x

Simplifying the left side gives us:

According to the given information, he found 22 bottle caps at the park, so his total number of bottle caps increased by 22: x + 22.

He also found 8 wrappers at the park, but since we are only interested in the number of bottle caps, we can ignore this information for now.

Now, Danny has a total of 28 bottle caps, so we can set up the equation: x + 22 = 28.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 22 from both sides: x + 22 - 22 = 28 - 22.

Simplifying both sides gives us: x = 6.

Therefore, Danny initially had 6 bottle caps.

32,jake has number0 fewer peaches than steven and number1 more peaches than jill . steven has number2 peaches . how many more peaches does steven have than jill ?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's represent the number of peaches Jill has as ""Jill's peaches"".
2. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake's peaches can be represented as ""Steven's peaches - 9"".
3. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, Jake's peaches can be represented as ""Jill's peaches + 18"".
4. We are given that Steven has 16 peaches. So, Steven's peaches can be represented as 16.

Now, let's use the given information to find the number of peaches Jill has.

We know that Jake's peaches and Steven's peaches are equal, except Jake has 9 fewer peaches. So we can set up an equation:

""Steven's peaches - 9 = Jill's peaches + 18""

Substituting the given values:

""16 - 9 = Jill's peaches + 18""

Simplifying the equation:

""7 = Jill's peaches + 18""

To isolate Jill's peaches, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

""7 - 18 = Jill's peaches""

Simplifying further:

""-11 = Jill's peaches""

Therefore, Jill has -11 peaches.

Now, let's calculate how many more peaches Steven has than Jill:

""Steven's peaches - Jill's peaches = 16 - (-11)""

Simplifying the calculation:

""16 + 11 = 27""

So, Steven has 27 more peaches than Jill.

37,paco had number0 cookies . he ate number1 cookies and gave number2 of them to his friend . how many cookies did paco have left ?,"Sure! Let's solve the math problem step by step.

1. Paco had 40 cookies.
2. He ate 5 cookies.
3. He gave 13 cookies to his friend.

To find out how many cookies Paco had left, we can subtract the number of cookies he ate and gave away from the starting number of cookies he had.

Starting with 40 cookies, Paco ate 5 cookies, so we subtract 5 from 40:
 40 - 5 = << 40 - 5 = 35 >> 35 

Then he gave away 13 cookies, so we subtract 13 from 35:
 35 - 13 = << 35 - 13 = 22 >> 22 

Therefore, Paco had 22 cookies left after eating 5 and giving away 13.

Initially, there were 43 children on the bus. After some children got off, there were 21 children left on the bus. 

We can represent this situation with the equation: 

43 - x = <<43 - x = 21>> 21

To find the value of ""x"", we need to solve this equation. 

First, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 21 from both sides of the equation: 

43 - x - 21 = <<43 - x - 21 = 21 - 21>> 21 - 21

Simplifying both sides gives us: 

22 - x = <<22 - x = 0>> 0

Next, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 22 from both sides of the equation: 

22 - x - 22 = <<22 - x - 22 = 0 - 22>> 0 - 22

Simplifying both sides gives us: 

-x = <<-x = -22>> -22

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: 

-1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-22)>> -1 * (-22)

Simplifying both sides gives us: 

x = <<x = 22>> 22

Therefore, 22 children got off the bus at the bus stop.
