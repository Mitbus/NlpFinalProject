1,julia played tag with number0 kids on monday . she played tag with number1 kids on tuesday . how many more kids did she play with on tuesday than on monday ?,"To find out how many more kids Julia played with on Tuesday than on Monday, we need to subtract the number of kids she played with on Monday from the number of kids she played with on Tuesday.

Let's represent the number of kids Julia played with on Monday as M and the number of kids she played with on Tuesday as T.

M = 11 (kids on Monday)
T = 12 (kids on Tuesday)

To find the difference, we subtract M from T:

T - M = 12 - 11

Calculating the difference:

T - M = 1

Therefore, Julia played with 1 more kid on Tuesday than on Monday.

If Bobby had 22 pieces of candy and he ate some pieces, then he would have 22 - x pieces of candy left.

After eating 5 more pieces, he would have (22 - x) - 5 pieces of candy left.

According to the problem, he still has 8 pieces of candy left, so we can set up the equation:

(22 - x) - 5 = 8

Simplifying the equation:

22 - x - 5 = 8

Combining like terms:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 17 from both sides:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

Simplifying:

-x = -9

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)

Simplifying:

x = 9

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation.
Subtracting 32 from both sides of the equation, we get: -x = 20 - 32.
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we have: -x = -12.
To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1.
Multiplying -1 to both sides, we get: x = -1 * -12.

Initially, Rachel had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some apples, so the number of apples left on the tree is given by subtracting the number of apples she picked from the initial number of apples: 4 - x.

According to the problem, there are now 2 apples left on the tree. So we can set up an equation: 4 - x = 2.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation by isolating ""x"" on one side:

4 - x = 2
-x = 2 - 4
-x = -2

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

1. Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree.
2. The tree now has 5 apples still on it.
3. Out of those 5 apples, 3 are ripe.

To find out how many unripe apples are left on the tree, we need to subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of remaining apples.

Total remaining apples = 5
Ripe apples = 3

Unripe apples = Total remaining apples - Ripe apples

Substituting the values:
Unripe apples = 5 - 3

Calculating:

To find the initial number of apples on the tree, we can set up an equation:

x - 6 (ripe apples picked) = 2 (remaining ripe apples) + 4 (remaining unripe apples)

Simplifying this equation:

x - 6 = 2 + 4

Combining like terms:

x - 6 = 6

Adding 6 to both sides of the equation:

x = 12

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug then, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had after losing them. So the calculation would be ((x + 29) - 17) - x.

Simplifying this expression, we get (x + 12) - x.

The x terms cancel out, leaving us with just 12.

Therefore, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 of his marbles at the playground.

Number of boys = 362
Number of girls = 257

403 more girls joined the school, so we need to add this to the initial number of girls.

Total number of girls after new admissions = 257 + 403

Now, we can calculate the difference between the total number of girls and the number of boys.

Difference = (Total number of girls) - (Number of boys)

Substituting the values:

Difference = (257 + 403) - 362

Calculating:

Difference = 660 - 362

Difference = 298

Therefore, the school has 298 more girls than boys.

194,there were number0 roses and number1 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now number2 roses and number3 orchids in the vase . how many orchids did she cut ?,"Let's assume that Jessica cut <<x>> roses and <<y>> orchids from her flower garden.

Initially, there were 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. After cutting some more flowers, there are now 10 roses and 21 orchids in the vase.

So, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

Number of roses: 12 + x = <<12 + x = 10>> 10
Number of orchids: 2 + y = <<2 + y = 21>> 21

To find out how many orchids Jessica cut, we need to solve the second equation for <<y>>.

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we have:
y = <<y = 21 - 2>> 21 - 2

Simplifying the right side of the equation:
y = <<y = 19>> 19

Initially, there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 13 + x = <<13 + x = 14>> 14
This equation represents the number of roses after Jessica cut some from her garden.

Equation 2: 84 + y = <<84 + y = 91>> 91
This equation represents the number of orchids after Jessica cut some from her garden.

Simplifying Equation 1, we have:
x = <<x = 14 - 13>> 14 - 13
x = <<x = 1>> 1

Simplifying Equation 2, we have:
y = <<y = 91 - 84>> 91 - 84
y = <<y = 7>> 7

According to the information given, Robin cut off 20 inches of her hair. Therefore, the remaining length of her hair after cutting is <<x - 20>>.

It is also mentioned that her hair is now 10 inches long. So we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = <<x - 20 = 10>> 10

To find the value of <<x>>, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x - 20 + 20 = <<x - 20 + 20 = 10 + 20>> 10 + 20

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = <<x = 30>> 30

Therefore, Robin's hair was originally 30 inches long before she cut it.

Initially, Josh had 9 marbles in his collection. If he lost ""x"" marbles, then the remaining number of marbles can be calculated by subtracting ""x"" from 9. 

So, the equation becomes: 9 - x = <<9 - x = 4>> 4. 

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides: 9 - x - 4 = <<9 - x - 4 = 4 - 4>> 4 - 4. 

Simplifying the equation gives us: 5 - x = <<5 - x = 0>> 0. 

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 5 from both sides: 5 - x - 5 = <<5 - x - 5 = 0 - 5>> 0 - 5. 

Simplifying further gives us: -x = <<-x = -5>> -5. 

To solve for ""x"", we can multiply both sides by -1: -1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-5)>> -1 * (-5).

According to the problem, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds together. So we can write the equation:

M + D = <<M + D = 22>> 22

On the way back, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. This means that Marco's strawberries now weigh <<M>> pounds, and his dad's strawberries weigh <<D + 30>> pounds. We are also given that Marco's strawberries now weigh a total of 36 pounds. So we can write another equation:

M + (D + 30) = <<M + (D + 30) = 36>> 36

We can solve this system of equations to find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries.

First, let's simplify the second equation:

M + D + 30 = <<M + D + 30 = 36>> 36

Next, let's substitute the value of <<M>> from the first equation into the second equation:

(22 - D) + D + 30 = <<(22 - D) + D + 30 = 36>> 36

Simplifying further:

2. Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron.
3. Ron stands at 13 feet.

To find out how deep the water is, we need to calculate Ron's height and then multiply it by 16.

Given that Dean is 9 feet taller than Ron, we can calculate Dean's height by adding 9 to Ron's height:
Dean's height = Ron's height + 9

Substituting Ron's height as 13 feet:
Dean's height = 13 + 9

Now that we know Dean's height, we can calculate Ron's height by subtracting 9 from Dean's height:
Ron's height = Dean's height - 9

Substituting Dean's height as calculated above:
Ron's height = (13 + 9) - 9

Now that we have Ron's height, we can calculate the depth of the water by multiplying it by 16:
Depth of water = Ron's height * 16

Substituting Ron's height as calculated above:
Depth of water = ((13 + 9) - 9) * 16

Simplifying the equation:
Depth of water = (22 - 9) * 16
Depth of water = (13) * 16
Depth of water = 208

2 slices/pizza * p pizzas = 28 slices

To find the value of ""p"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2 slices/pizza, we get: 

p pizzas = 28 slices / 2 slices/pizza

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we have: 

p pizzas = 14

So, we ordered 14 pizzas.

312,matthew had number0 crackers . if matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his number1 friends and still had number2 crackers left how many crackers did each friend eat ?,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of division. Matthew started with 15 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to his 5 friends. We need to find out how many crackers each friend ate.

Let's denote the number of crackers each friend ate as ""x"". So, Matthew gave away a total of 5 * x crackers to his friends. After giving away these crackers, Matthew had 10 crackers left.

We can express this situation with the following equation: 15 - (5 * x) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 10 from both sides: 15 - (5 * x) - 10 = 10 - 10.

Simplifying the left side gives us: 5 - (5 * x) = 0.

2. Rearrange the equation: - (5 * x) + 5 = 0.

3. Subtract 5 from both sides: - (5 * x) + 5 - 5 = 0 - 5.

Simplifying the left side gives us: - (5 * x) = -5.

4. Divide both sides by -5: (-5 * x) / -5 = -5 / -5.

Simplifying the left side gives us: x = 1.

So, each friend ate 1 cracker.

Let's represent the number of days she drank for as ""d"". 

The total number of bottles she bought is 301, and she has 157 bottles left. So, the number of bottles she drank can be calculated by subtracting the number of bottles left from the total number of bottles bought: 

301 - 157 = 144

We know that Debby drank 144 bottles a day for ""d"" days. So, the total number of bottles she drank can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottles she drank per day (144) by the number of days (d):

144 * d = 144d

Since we know that Debby drank a total of 144 bottles, we can set up an equation:

144d = 144

To find the value of ""d"", we can divide both sides of the equation by 144:

(144d)/144 = 144/144

Simplifying this equation gives us:

d = 1

Therefore, Debby drank for 1 day.

391,lucy went to the grocery store . she bought number0 packs of cookie and some packs of cake . in total she had number1 packs of grocery how many packs of cake did she buy in all ?,"Let's solve the math problem step by step.

We know that Lucy bought 23 packs of cookies and some packs of cake. Let's represent the number of packs of cake as ""x"".

So, the total number of packs of grocery that Lucy had is the sum of the packs of cookies and packs of cake, which is equal to 27.

Mathematically, we can represent this as an equation:

23 + x = <<23 + x = 27>> 27

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 23 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 27 - 23>> 27 - 23

x = <<x = 4>> 4

Therefore, Lucy bought 4 packs of cake in all.
