"I need to figure out how to get the amount from a phone bill sent to Boston on June 16 . The Rate for First Minute is 0.4698 , the Rate for Additional Minutes is 0.374 , and the Total Minutes are 17 . How much is the bill ?" ; "To calculate the phone bill, we need to determine the cost for the first minute and the cost for additional minutes, and then multiply them by the total number of minutes.

The rate for the first minute is given as 0.4698. To find the cost for the first minute, we multiply this rate by 1 (since it's only one minute):
 0.4698 * 1 = << 0.4698 * 1 = 0.4698 >> 0.4698 

The rate for additional minutes is given as 0.374. To find the cost for additional minutes, we multiply this rate by the total number of additional minutes, which is obtained by subtracting 1 from the total number of minutes:
 0.374 * (17 - 1) = << 0.374 * (17 - 1) = 0.374 * 16 = 5.984 >> 0.374 * 16 = 5.984 

Finally, to find the total bill amount, we add the cost for the first minute to the cost for additional minutes:
 0.4698 + 5.984 = << 0.4698 + 5.984 = 6.4538 >> 6.4538 

Therefore, the phone bill sent to Boston on June 16 is $6.4538.

"Mrs. Hilt baked pies last weekend for a holiday dinner . She baked 16 pecan pies and 14 apples pies . If she wants to arrange all of the pies in rows of 5 pies each , how many rows will she have ?" ; "To solve this problem, we need to determine how many rows of 5 pies each Mrs. Hilt can arrange given that she has baked 16 pecan pies and 14 apple pies.

First, let's add the number of pecan pies and apple pies to get the total number of pies:

 16 (pecan pies) + 14 (apple pies) = << 16 (pecan pies) + 14 (apple pies) = 30 >> 30 

Now, we need to find out how many rows of 5 pies each we can get from these 30 pies. To do this, we divide the total number of pies by the number of pies in each row:

 30 (total pies) / 5 (pies per row) = << 30 (total pies) / 5 (pies per row) = 6 >> 6 

Since we can't have a fraction of a row, we'll round down to the nearest whole number. This gives us:

<< 6 (rows) >>

So, Mrs. Hilt will have 6 rows of pies.

"Your class had a pizza party . 0.375 of a pizza was left over , and 0.5 of another pizza was left over . You put them both into one box . How much pizza do you have altogether ?" ; "To find out how much pizza we have altogether, we need to add the amount of leftover pizza from each pizza.

First, let's convert the fractions into decimals:
0.375 = 3/8
0.5 = 1/2

Now, let's add the two fractions together:
3/8 + 1/2

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 8 and 2 is 8. So, we can rewrite the fractions with a common denominator of 8:
3/8 + 4/8

Now that the denominators are the same, we can add the numerators:
(3 + 4)/8 = 7/8

So, we have a total of 7/8 of a pizza leftover.

To convert this fraction into a decimal, we divide the numerator by the denominator:
7 / 8 = 0.875

Therefore, altogether we have 0.875 (or 87.5%) of a pizza leftover.

According to the information given, when Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 cans of cat food each day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1  x = <<1  x = 0.5>> 0.5

Simplifying this equation, we find that x = <<x = 0.5>> 0.5.

Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans each day. We can set up another equation to represent this situation:

"there are some children at a bakery . as they were deciding what to buy 24 girls came in and 31 boys left . if there are 78 children in the bakery in the end how many children were there at first ?" ; "Let's assume the number of children at the bakery at first is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the problem, 24 girls came in, so we can add 24 to the initial number of children: <<x + 24>>.

Similarly, 31 boys left, so we subtract 31 from the previous result: <<(x + 24) - 31>>.

Finally, we know that there are 78 children in the bakery in the end, so we can set up the equation (x + 24) - 31 = <<(x + 24) - 31 = 78>> 78.

To find the value of <<x>>, we can solve this equation:

(x + 24) - 31 = <<(x + 24) - 31 = 78>> 78

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

x + 24 - 31 = <<x + 24 - 31 = 78>> 78

Next, let's combine like terms:

x - 7 = <<x - 7 = 78>> 78

To isolate <<x>>, we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side. We can do this by adding 7 to both sides of the equation:

x - 7 + 7 = <<x - 7 + 7 = 78 + 7>> 78 + 7

Simplifying further:

x = <<x = 85>> 85

Therefore, there were initially #### children at the bakery.

Dividing 24 by 12 gives us a quotient of 2 and no remainder. This means that Sarah sold exactly enough boxes to fill 2 cases.

To find the extra boxes, we multiply the quotient (number of cases) by the number of boxes in each case and subtract it from the total number of boxes sold:
 tExtra boxes = << tExtra boxes = (2 * 12) - 24 >> (2 * 12) - 24 

Multiplying 2 by 12 gives us 24, and subtracting it from the total number of boxes sold (24) gives us zero. This means that Sarah doesn't need any extra boxes.

Therefore, Sarah needs 2 cases of 12 boxes and no extra boxes.

"Will had 57 dollars . If he spent 27 bucks on a new game , how many 6 dollar toys could he buy with the money he had left ?" ; "To find out how many 6 dollar toys Will can buy with the money he had left after spending 27 dollars on a new game, we need to subtract the amount spent from the initial amount of money.

Initial amount of money = <<57
Amount spent on a new game = >>27

Money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent
Money left = <<57 - >>27

To calculate this, we subtract the two amounts:

<<57 - >>27 = <<30

Will has >>30 left after buying the new game. 

Now, we need to determine how many 6 dollar toys Will can buy with this remaining money. We can do this by dividing the remaining money by the cost of each toy.

Cost of each toy = <<6
Remaining money = >>30

Number of toys Will can buy = Remaining money / Cost of each toy
Number of toys Will can buy = <<30 / >>6

To calculate this, we divide the two amounts:

<<30 / >>6 = 5

Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he had left.

"As Alyssa was searching through her couch cushions , she found 12 quarters , and 7 pennies in the couch . How much money in total does Alyssa have ?" ; "To find out how much money Alyssa has, we need to calculate the total value of the quarters and pennies.

First, let's determine the value of the quarters. Each quarter is worth 25 cents, so we can multiply the number of quarters (12) by the value of each quarter (25 cents).

 12 * 25 = << 12 * 25 = 300 >> 300  cents

Next, let's determine the value of the pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so we can multiply the number of pennies (7) by the value of each penny (1 cent).

 7 * 1 = << 7 * 1 = 7 >> 7  cents

Now, we need to convert the total value from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the total value in cents by 100.

 3 / 00 + 7}100 = << 3 / 00 + 7}100 = 3 / 07}100 = 3.07 >> 3 / 07}100 = 3.07

 tTotal number of crayons = << tTotal number of crayons = tNumber of crayons per person * tNumber of people >> tNumber of crayons per person * tNumber of people 

Given that there are 24 crayons in total and three people, we can substitute these values into the equation:

 24 = << 24 = tNumber of crayons per person * 3 >> tNumber of crayons per person * 3 

To solve for the number of crayons per person, we can isolate the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

 2 / 43 = << 2 / 43 = \ / textNumber of crayons per person * 3}3 >> \ / textNumber of crayons per person * 3}3 

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

Given that each adult meal costs <<3 and there were 12 people in total, with 7 of them being kids, we can calculate the number of adults in the group by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 12 - 7

Now that we know the number of adults, we can calculate the cost of their meals by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal.

Cost of adult meals = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Cost of adult meals = (12 - 7) * >>3

Simplifying this calculation:

Cost of adult meals = 5 * <<3

"On a recent trip to CA , we averaged 50 miles per hour . On the return trip we averaged 60 miles per hour . Determine the average speed of the trip to CA and back ." ; "To determine the average speed of the trip to CA and back, we can use the concept of harmonic mean. The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

Let's assume that the distance to CA is D miles. Therefore, the distance back from CA is also D miles.

The time taken to travel to CA at an average speed of 50 miles per hour can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. So, the time taken to travel to CA is D / 50 hours.

Similarly, the time taken to travel back from CA at an average speed of 60 miles per hour is D / 60 hours.

The total distance traveled for the round trip is 2D miles (D miles to CA + D miles back from CA).

The total time taken for the round trip is (D / 50) + (D / 60) hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.

Substituting in the values we have:

average speed = (2D) / ((D / 50) + (D / 60))

To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator for (D / 50) and (D / 60). The least common multiple of 50 and 60 is 300.

average speed = (2D) / ((6D/300) + (5D/300))

Combining like terms:

average speed = (2D) / ((11D/300))

Dividing both numerator and denominator by D:

average speed = (2/11) * (300)

Calculating this expression:

average speed = 600/11

"George has 2 boxes of blocks . Each box holds 6 blocks and there are 5 boxes in a case . How many blocks does George have ?" ; "To solve this problem, we need to understand the quantities given in the problem statement.

- George has 2 boxes of blocks.
- Each box holds 6 blocks.
- There are 5 boxes in a case.

We can start by calculating the total number of blocks in each box. Since each box holds 6 blocks and George has 2 boxes, the total number of blocks in all of George's boxes is 2 * 6 = <<2 * 6 = 12>> 12 blocks.

Next, we need to consider the number of boxes in a case. Since there are 5 boxes in a case and we have already calculated that George has 2 boxes, we can add these quantities together to find the total number of boxes that George has. This gives us 2 + 5 = <<2 + 5 = 7>> 7 boxes.

Finally, we can multiply the total number of blocks in each box by the total number of boxes to find the total number of blocks that George has. This gives us 12 * 7 = <<12 * 7 = 84>> 84 blocks.

"Debby bought two coloring books . One had 16 pictures and the other had 40 . After one week she had already colored 33 of the pictures . How many pictures does she still have to color ?" ; "Debby bought two coloring books, one with 16 pictures and the other with 40 pictures. After one week, she had already colored 33 of the pictures. To find out how many pictures she still has to color, we need to subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures.

Total number of pictures = 16 + 40 = 56
Number of colored pictures = 33

To find the number of pictures Debby still has to color, we subtract the number of colored pictures from the total number of pictures:

56 - 33 = ####

"Rose has 9 apples and 12 erasers . If she shares the apples among 3 friends , how many apples does each friend get ?" ; "To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of apples that Rose has by the number of friends she is sharing them with.

Rose has 9 apples. She wants to share them with 3 friends. 

To find out how many apples each friend gets, we divide the total number of apples by the number of friends. 

Here's how you can do it:

 9 / 3 = << 9 / 3 = 3 >> 3 

So, each friend gets 3 apples.

"Mrs. Hilt measured the distance from her desk to the water fountain . It was 30 feet . How many feet will Mrs. Hilt walk on her trips to the fountain if she goes to the water fountain 4 times today ?" ; "To find out how many feet Mrs. Hilt will walk on her trips to the fountain, we need to multiply the distance from her desk to the water fountain by the number of times she goes to the fountain.

The distance from her desk to the water fountain is given as 30 feet.

Mrs. Hilt goes to the water fountain 4 times today.

To calculate the total distance she will walk, we can multiply the distance per trip (30 feet) by the number of trips (4).

 30 * 4 = << 30 * 4 = 120 >> 120 

Therefore, Mrs. Hilt will walk a total of 120 feet on her trips to the water fountain today.

"1 cell phone plan costs 49 dollars per month . The first 95 minutes of use are free . Each minute thereafter costs 2500 dollars . For a bill of 0.25 dollars , how many minutes over 112 was the cell phone in use ?" ; "To find out how many minutes over 112 the cell phone was in use, we need to calculate the total cost of the bill and then subtract the cost of the first 112 minutes.

The cost for each minute after the first 95 minutes is 2500. So, the cost for each additional minute is >>2500 - <<0 (since the first 95 minutes are free) = <<2500. So, the cost for each additional minute is >>2500 - <<0 (since the first 95 minutes are free) = >> 2500.

Let's calculate the cost for the additional minutes:
Number of additional minutes = Total minutes - First 95 minutes - 112
Number of additional minutes = Total minutes - 95 - 112

Since we know that the bill amount is <<0.25, we can set up an equation:
Total cost = Cost for first 112 minutes + Cost for additional minutes
>>0.25 = <<0 + Number of additional minutes * >>2500

Now, let's solve this equation to find the number of additional minutes:
0.25 = <<0.25 = Number of additional minutes * >> Number of additional minutes * 2500
Number of additional minutes = <<0.25 / >>2500

Calculating this division gives us:
Number of additional minutes = 0.0001

Therefore, the cell phone was in use for 0.0001 minutes over 112.

"James had 39 stickers . He got some more stickers for his birthday . Then he had 61 stickers . How many stickers did James get for his birthday ?" ; "To find out how many stickers James got for his birthday, we can set up an equation.

Let's say James got ""x"" stickers for his birthday.

Initially, James had 39 stickers. After receiving more stickers for his birthday, he ended up with 61 stickers.

So, we can set up the equation:

 39 + x = << 39 + x = 61 >> 61 

To solve for ""x"", we can isolate it on one side of the equation.

 x = << x = 61 - 39 >> 61 - 39 

Now, let's do the calculation to find the value of ""x"".

 x = << x = 22 >> 22 

Therefore, James got 22 stickers for his birthday.

"White t - shirts can be purchased in packages of 6 . If Mom buys 71 packages , how many white t - shirts will Mom have ?" ; "To find the total number of white t-shirts Mom will have, we need to multiply the number of packages by the number of t-shirts in each package.

Given that there are 6 t-shirts in each package and Mom buys 71 packages, we can calculate the total number of white t-shirts as follows:

 6 * 71 = << 6 * 71 = 426 >> 426 

Therefore, Mom will have 426 white t-shirts.

"Each bottle cap costs 5 . How much do 5 bottle caps cost ?" ; "To find out how much 5 bottle caps cost, we can multiply the cost of one bottle cap by the number of bottle caps. 

The cost of one bottle cap is <<5. 

So, to find the cost of 5 bottle caps, we can multiply >>5 by 5: 

<<5 * 5 = 25. 

Therefore, 5 bottle caps cost >>25.
