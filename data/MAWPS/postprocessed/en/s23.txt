"an industrial machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today . it can make 8 shirts a minute . how many minutes did the machine work in all ?" ; "To find out how many minutes the machine worked in total, we can break it down into two steps:

Step 1: Calculate the total number of shirts the machine made.
Step 2: Calculate the number of minutes it took to make these shirts.

Step 1: The machine made 13 shirts yesterday and 3 shirts today, so the total number of shirts it made is:

13 + 3 = <<13 + 3 = 16>> 16 shirts.

Step 2: We know that the machine can make 8 shirts per minute. To find out how many minutes it took to make 16 shirts, we can set up a proportion:

\ / textNumber of minutes}t{Number of shirts} = <<\ / textNumber of minutes}t{Number of shirts} = 8 / 1>> 8 / 1

Now, we can solve for the number of minutes:

tNumber of minutes = <<tNumber of minutes = 8 / 1 * 1 / 61 = 8 * 16 = 128>> 8 / 1 * 1 / 61 = 8 * 16 = 128 minutes.

1. The total earnings in 30 days is <<420.

2. Together with the ring toss game, they earned >>22.

To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we'll first subtract the earnings from the game they made together with the <<22 from the total earnings of >>420:

Total earnings - Earnings from other games = Earnings from the ring toss game
<<420 - >>22 = Earnings from the ring toss game

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the ring toss game per day by dividing the total earnings from the ring toss game by the number of days (30):

Earnings from the ring toss game / Number of days = Earnings per day
(Earnings from the ring toss game) / 30 = Earnings per day

Now, we need to calculate the total time required to install these remaining 9 windows. Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of remaining windows by 4 to get the total time:

9 * 4 = <<9 * 4 = 36>> 36

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.

"A painter needed to paint 12 rooms in a building . Each room takes 3 hours to paint . If he already painted 4 rooms , how much longer will he take to paint the rest ?" ; "To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we need to calculate the total time it will take to paint all the rooms and subtract the time already spent.

The total time to paint all the rooms can be calculated by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint each room. In this case, there are 12 rooms and each room takes 3 hours to paint, so the total time is 12 * 3 = <<12 * 3 = 36>> 36 hours.

The time already spent painting 4 rooms can be calculated by multiplying the number of rooms already painted by the time it takes to paint each room. In this case, 4 rooms have already been painted and each room takes 3 hours to paint, so the time already spent is 4 * 3 = <<4 * 3 = 12>> 12 hours.

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we subtract the time already spent from the total time. So, the remaining time can be calculated as 36 - 12 = <<36 - 12 = 24>> 24 hours.

Therefore, the painter will take 24 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

"Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash . He put 40 of them in one load , but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads . How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads ?" ; "Jerry had 60 pieces of clothing to wash. He put 40 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. 

To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of clothes in the first load from the total number of clothes and then divide it by the number of small loads.

Total number of clothes - Number of clothes in first load = Number of clothes for small loads
60 - 40 = Number of clothes for small loads

Now, we can divide the number of clothes for small loads by the number of small loads to find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each load.

Number of clothes for small loads / Number of small loads = Number of pieces per load
(60 - 40) / 5 = Number of pieces per load

Calculating this expression gives us:

20 / 5 = Number of pieces per load

Therefore, each small load can contain 4 pieces of clothing.

"a tourist group has 26 people . at a hotel they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each . in order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied how many large rooms should be rented ?" ; "To find the number of large rooms that should be rented in order to have every room fully occupied with the least number of rooms, we can use the concept of division.

Let's assume the number of large rooms to be rented as ""x"". Since each large room can accommodate 3 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""x"" large rooms would be 3x.

Similarly, let's assume the number of small rooms to be rented as ""y"". Since each small room can accommodate 2 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""y"" small rooms would be 2y.

According to the given information, there are a total of 26 people in the tourist group. Therefore, we can write an equation based on the total number of people:

3x + 2y = 26

To minimize the number of rooms required, we need to find the smallest possible values for ""x"" and ""y"" that satisfy this equation.

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start with assuming a value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 0 (i.e., no large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 0 into the equation: 
   3(0) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying: 
   2y = 26
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 13

   So, if no large rooms are rented (x = 0), we would need to rent 13 small rooms.

2. Now, let's assume a value for ""x"" again. Let's assume x = 1 (i.e., one large room is rented).

   Substituting x = 1 into the equation:
   3(1) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying:
   3 + 2y = 26
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   2y = 23
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 11.5

   Since the number of rooms must be a whole number, we cannot have a fraction of a room. Therefore, assuming x = 1 does not give us a valid solution.

3. Let's assume another value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 2 (i.e., two large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 2 into the

Let's assume that it takes x days for Jane to finish arranging all the flower vases.

We know that Jane can arrange 16 vases of flowers in a day. So, in x days, she would be able to arrange 16x vases of flowers.

According to the problem, there are 248 vases of flowers to be arranged. Therefore, we can set up the following proportion:

16/1 = 248/x

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

16x = 248 * 1

Simplifying the right side:

16x = 248

Now, let's solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 16:

x = 248/16

Calculating this division:

x = 15.5

Since we cannot have half a day, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jane would need approximately 16 days to finish arranging all the flower vases.

"there were 48 people on the train . after the first stop there were 31 people left . how many people got off ?" ; "To find out how many people got off the train, we need to subtract the number of people left after the first stop from the initial number of people on the train.

Initial number of people on the train: 48
Number of people left after the first stop: 31

To find out how many people got off, we can subtract the number of people left from the initial number of people:

 48 - 31 = << 48 - 31 = 17 >> 17 

Therefore, 17 people got off the train.

Number of books sold = 2

Therefore, Gwen sold 2 books.

"a pet store had 85 gerbils . if they sold 69 of them how many would they have left ?" ; "To find out how many gerbils the pet store would have left after selling 69 of them, we can subtract 69 from the initial number of gerbils.

Initial number of gerbils = 85
Number of gerbils sold = 69

To find the remaining number of gerbils, we subtract the number sold from the initial number:

Remaining gerbils = Initial number - Number sold
Remaining gerbils = 85 - 69

Performing the subtraction:

Remaining gerbils = 16

Therefore, the pet store would have 16 gerbils left.
