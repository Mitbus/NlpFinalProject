"46 apples were in the basket . 22 are red and the rest are green . how many apples are green ?" ; "Sure, let's solve this problem step by step using calculations with << symbols.

Step 1: Start with the total number of apples in the basket, which is 46.

>>Total\ apples = 46<<

Step 2: We know that 22 of these apples are red, so we need to find out how many are green. To do that, we'll subtract the number of red apples from the total number of apples.

"some oranges were in the basket . 5 oranges were taken from the basket . now there are 3 oranges . how many oranges were in the basket before some of the oranges were taken ?" ; "Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. ""Some oranges were in the basket.""
Let's represent the number of oranges in the basket with a variable, say <<x>>.

2. ""5 oranges were taken from the basket.""
This means 5 oranges were removed from the basket, so we subtract 5 from the number of oranges in the basket.

3. ""Now there are 3 oranges.""
This tells us that after removing 5 oranges, there are 3 oranges left in the basket.

Now, we can set up the equation:

 x - 5 = << x - 5 = 3 >> 3 

To find the value of <<x>>, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate <<x:

>> x - 5 + 5 = 3 + 5 <<

This simplifies to:

"George has 5 boxes of eggs . Each box holds 3 eggs and there are 9 boxes in a case . How many eggs does George have ?" ; "To find out how many eggs George has, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. First, we need to calculate how many boxes George has. George has 5 boxes of eggs.

<<5>> boxes

2. Next, we need to find out how many eggs are in each box. Each box holds 3 eggs.

Each box holds <<3>> eggs

3. Now, let's calculate how many eggs George has in total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of eggs in each box.

5>> boxes * Each box holds <<3>> eggs = <<5>> boxes * Each box holds <<3>> eggs = <<15>> <<15 eggs

4. Finally, we need to account for the fact that there are 9 boxes in a case. To find out how many cases George has, we can divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes in a case.

5>> boxes / 9 boxes in a case = <<5>> boxes / 9 boxes in a case = <<0.5555...>> <<0.5555...

However, since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as it wouldn't make sense to have a fraction of a case in this context.

So, George has <<0>> cases.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs George has:

George has 0>> cases * 9 boxes in a case = <<0>> cases * 9 boxes in a case = <<0>> <<0 boxes

5. Finally, to find out how many eggs George has in total, we can multiply the number of cases by the number of eggs in each case.

The problem states that the total amount of soup needed is 280 cups. The first team made 90 cups and the third team made 70 cups. Therefore, the amount of soup the second team needs to make can be calculated as:

"ed had 22 more marbles than doug . doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground . how many more marble did ed have than doug then ?" ; "Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the given information. Let's say Doug has x marbles.

According to the problem, Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug, so Ed would have x + 22 marbles.

Next, we are told that Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. So, Doug would then have x - 8 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug after Doug lost 8 marbles, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has.

Therefore, the number of marbles Ed had more than Doug would be (x + 22) - (x - 8).

Simplifying this expression, we get x + 22 - x + 8.

Combining like terms, we have 30.

Therefore, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug.

"a worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep . it climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day . how many days will it take the worm to reach the top ?" ; " Here is my step by step solution for the given math problem:

The worm starts at 26 inches deep in the hole.
Every day, it climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches.  
So on the first day, it climbs up 8 inches to 18 inches deep.   
Then it slides back 3 inches to 21 inches deep.    
On the second day, it again climbs up 8 inches to 13 inches deep.  
Then it slides back 3 inches to 16 inches deep.
We need to find how many days it takes for the worm to reach the surface at 0 inches deep.
Let's call the number of days <<n>>.   
The pattern is:    
The worm climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches every day.
So on day <<n>>, the worm will climb <<8n>> inches total and slide back <<3n>> inches.
Since it needs to reach 0 inches deep, we can set up an equation:
26 - (8n - 3n) = <<26 - (8n - 3n) = 0>> 0
Solving for <<n>>:
26 - 5n = <<26 - 5n = 0>> 0
5n = <<5n = 26>> 26
n = <<n = 26/5>> 26/5
n = <<n = 5>> 5 days

We know that Maura found 75 seashells initially and gave some to her sister. After giving some to her sister, she had 57 seashells left. 

So, we can write the equation: 75 - x = 57.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation.

Starting with 75, subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us: 75 - x - x = 57 - x.

Simplifying the equation gives us: 75 - 2x = 57.

To isolate the variable, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation: 75 - 2x - 75 = 57 - 75.

Simplifying the equation gives us: -2x = -18.

Finally, to solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2x) / -2 = (-18) / -2.

Simplifying the equation gives us: x = 9.

Therefore, Maura gave 9 seashells to her sister.

"the central city zoo has 45 chimpanzees . every day the chimps eat a total of 72 bananas . next week the zoo is moving 18 chimps to a new cage . how many chimps will stay in the old cage ?" ; "Let's start by finding out how many bananas each chimp eats per day. To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of chimps.

Total bananas per day = 72
Number of chimps = 45

So, bananas per chimp per day = Total bananas per day / Number of chimps

Bananas per chimp per day = 72 / 45 = 1.6 bananas

Next, let's find out how many bananas the 18 chimps that are being moved eat per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas per chimp per day by the number of chimps being moved.

Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas
Number of chimps being moved = 18

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = Bananas per chimp per day * Number of chimps being moved

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 1.6 * 18 = 28.8 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas the remaining chimps in the old cage eat per day. We can do this by subtracting the bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day from the total bananas per day.

Total bananas per day = 72 bananas
Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 28.8 bananas

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = Total bananas per day - Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 72 - 28.8 = 43.2 bananas

Since each chimp eats 1.6 bananas per day, we can find out how many chimps will stay in the old cage by dividing the bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day by the number of bananas per chimp per day.

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 43.2 bananas
Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day / Bananas per chimp per day

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = 43.2 / 1.6 = 27

Therefore, 27 chimps will stay in the old cage.####

32 + y - 32 = <<32 + y - 32 = 50 - 32>> 50 - 32

This simplifies to:

y = <<y = 18>> 18

Therefore, Kevin collected 18 yo-yos.

"jasper is in charge of the refreshments . he sold 27 bags of chips . he sold 8 fewer hot dogs than chips . he sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs . how many drinks did jasper sell ?" ; "Let's break down the information given:

- Jasper sold 27 bags of chips.
- He sold 8 fewer hot dogs than chips.
- He sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs.

To find the number of drinks Jasper sold, we need to determine the number of hot dogs he sold first. 

Since he sold 8 fewer hot dogs than chips, we can subtract 8 from the number of bags of chips to find the number of hot dogs:

27 - 8 = <<27 - 8 = 19>> 19

Jasper sold 19 hot dogs.

Next, we need to determine the number of drinks he sold. 

Since he sold 12 more drinks than hot dogs, we can add 12 to the number of hot dogs to find the number of drinks:

19 + 12 = <<19 + 12 = 31>> 31

Jasper sold 31 drinks.

"the ice rink has 85 pairs of skates to rent . 18 people rented skates when the ice rink opened . 25 more people rented skates during the first hour . how many pairs of skates are left ?" ; "To find out how many pairs of skates are left, we need to subtract the number of skates rented from the total number of skates available.

The total number of skates available is 85 pairs.

The number of skates rented when the ice rink opened is 18 pairs.

During the first hour, an additional 25 people rented skates.

So, the number of skates rented during the first hour is 25 pairs.

To find out how many pairs of skates are left, we subtract the total number of skates rented from the total number of skates available.

Total skates rented = 18 + 25 = 43 pairs

Pairs of skates left = Total skates available - Total skates rented
Pairs of skates left = 85 - 43

Therefore, there are #### pairs of skates left.

First, we know that Jake started with 80 pieces of candy. On Monday, he sold 15 pieces. So, to find out how many pieces he had left after Monday, we can subtract 15 from 80.

 80 - 15 = << 80 - 15 = 65 >> 65 

Therefore, after Monday, Jake had 65 pieces of candy left.

Next, we are told that Jake had only 7 pieces of candy left by Wednesday. This means that between Monday and Wednesday, Jake sold some more candy. To find out how many pieces he sold on Tuesday, we need to subtract the number of pieces he had left on Wednesday from the number of pieces he had left after Monday.

 65 - 7 = << 65 - 7 = 58 >> 58

"last week adam ran 25 miles more than katie . adam ran 35 miles . how many miles did katie run ?" ; "Let's use algebraic reasoning to solve this problem without using ""x.""

Let A represent the number of miles Adam ran, and K represent the number of miles Katie ran.

We know from the problem that:
1. Adam ran 25 miles more than Katie: A = K + 25
2. Adam ran 35 miles: A = 35

Now, we can substitute the value of A from the second equation into the first equation:

35 = K + 25

To solve for K, we need to isolate K on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 25 from both sides:

K = 35 - 25

K = 10

So, Katie ran 10 miles.

1. The high school played 18 baseball games.
2. 2 of these games were at night.
3. The team won most of their games.
4. They were defeated during 3 games.

To find out how many games the team won, we can start by calculating the total number of games they lost and the games they won.

Total Games = 18 (the number of games played)
Games at Night = 2

To isolate x, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

- x = 9 - 18

Now, calculate the right side of the equation:

- x = -9

To find the number of cookies eaten, we need to make the value of x positive. Since it represents cookies eaten, we can take the absolute value of -9 to get the number of cookies eaten:

|-9| = 9

So, 9 cookies were eaten.

We can do this by finding the cost of the chocolate and carob separately and then adding them together. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Cost of 2 pounds of chocolate:
   The cost of 1 pound of chocolate is <<2, so the cost of 2 pounds of chocolate is >>2 * 2 = <<4.

2. Cost of 55 pounds of carob candy:
   The cost of 1 pound of carob candy is >>7, so the cost of 55 pounds of carob candy is 7 * 55 = <<7 * 55 = >> 385.

3. Total cost of the mixture:
   The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of chocolate and carob candy, so it is <<4 + >>385 = <<389.

4. Total weight of the mixture:
   The total weight of the mixture is the sum of the weight of chocolate and carob candy, so it is 2 pounds + 55 pounds = 57 pounds.

5. Cost per pound of the mixture:
   To find the cost per pound of the mixture, we divide the total cost by the total weight, so it is >>389 / 57 pounds.

"mrs. hilt went to a concert . a total of 65899 people attended the concert . the next week she went to a second concert which had 119 more people in attendance . how many people were at the second concert ?" ; "Mrs. Hilt attended two concerts, and we need to find the number of people at the second concert.

Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as <<F>> and the number of people at the second concert as <<S>>. We know that the total number of people who attended both concerts is 65,899.

So, we can write the equation:
F + S = <<F + S = 65,899>> 65,899

We also know that the second concert had 119 more people in attendance than the first concert, so we can write another equation:
S = <<S = F + 119>> F + 119

Now we can use these two equations to solve for the number of people at the second concert. First, we'll substitute the second equation into the first one:

F + (F + 119) = <<F + (F + 119) = 65,899>> 65,899

Now, we can combine the terms:

2F + 119 = <<2F + 119 = 65,899>> 65,899

Subtract 119 from both sides to isolate 2F:

2F = <<2F = 65,899 - 119>> 65,899 - 119

2F = <<2F = 65,780>> 65,780

Now, divide by 2 to find the number of people at the first concert, F:

F = <<F = 6 / 5,780}2>> 6 / 5,780}2

Now, calculate F:

F = <<F = 32,890>> 32,890

So, there were 32,890 people at the first concert. To find the number of people at the second concert, use the second equation:

S = <<S = F + 119>> F + 119

S = <<S = 32,890 + 119>> 32,890 + 119

S = <<S = 33,009>> 33,009

So, there were 33,009 people at the second concert.

5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = <<5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}>> x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for <<x>>:

5  1 = <<5  1 = 2x>> 2x

5 = <<5 = 2x>> 2x

To solve for <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = <<x = 5 / 2>> 5 / 2

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

x = <<x = 2.5>> 2.5

So, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make 1 loaf of bread.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Number of fleas in Harry Hound's right ear: 36
2. Number of fleas in his left ear: 85
3. Total number of fleas initially found in both ears: 36 (right ear) + 85 (left ear)

Now, we can calculate how many fleas perished:

Total fleas initially found - (Fleas in the right ear + Fleas in the left ear)

So,

36 + 85 = 121

Initial number of fleas - 121 (total in both ears) = Perished fleas

1. Blithe initially had a certain number of toys.
2. He lost 6 toys, which means he had 6 less toys than before.
3. Then he found 9 toys in his closet, which means he had 9 more toys than after losing some.

So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Initial number of toys - 6 (lost) + 9 (found) = 43

Now, we can solve for the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys - 6 + 9 = 43

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

Initial number of toys + 9 = 43 + 6

Initial number of toys + 9 = 49

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to find the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys = 49 - 9

Initial number of toys = 40

So, Blithe initially had 40 toys.

After 7 more passengers got on the bus, the total number of passengers increased by 7 to become ""x + 7"".

Then, 9 passengers got off the bus, which means the total number of passengers decreased by 9 to become ""(x + 7) - 9"".

Finally, we know that in the end there are 26 passengers on the bus, so we can set up the equation:

""(x + 7) - 9 = 26""

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

(x + 7) - 9 = 26

After losing 4 books, Bruno's dad gave him 10 more books, so the total number of books he had after his dad gave him the books is ""x - 4 + 10"".

We are given that Bruno had 39 books after his dad gave him the books, so we can set up the equation:

x - 4 + 10 = 39

Simplifying the equation:

x + 6 = 39

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

"chloe and her friends were recycling paper for their class . for every 6 pounds they recycled they earned 1 point . if chloe recycled 28 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds how many points did they earn ?" ; "To find out how many points Chloe and her friends earned, we need to calculate the number of points earned for Chloe's 28 pounds of recycled paper and her friends' 2 pounds.

For every 6 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.

<<>>
6 / t pounds}1 t{ point} = 2 / 8 t pounds}x t{ points}
<<>>

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

<<>>
6  x = 28  1
<<>>

<<>>
6x = 28
<<>>

To isolate x (the number of points), divide both sides of the equation by 6:

<<>>
x = 2 / 86
<<>>

Now, simplify the fraction:

<<>>
x = 42 / 6
<<>>

To express this as a whole number with a remainder, we can divide 4 by 6:

<<>>
4 / 6 = 0 with a remainder of 4
<<>>

So, the answer is that Chloe and her friends earned 4 points with 2 pounds of paper recycling.

"victor and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 8 dollars each . how much did they spend if victor bought 6 decks and his friend bought 2 decks ?" ; "To find out how much Victor and his friend spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the decks they bought separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate how much Victor spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck costs 8 dollars and Victor bought 6 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks:  8 * 6 = << 8 * 6 = 48 >> 48 .

Next, let's calculate how much Victor's friend spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck also costs 8 dollars and his friend bought 2 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks:  8 * 2 = << 8 * 2 = 16 >> 16 .

Now, let's add the amounts spent by Victor and his friend to find the total amount spent:  48 + 16 = << 48 + 16 = 64 >> 64 .

Therefore, they spent a total of 64 dollars on the trick decks.

"faye 's team won their baseball game and scored 68 points total . if faye scored 28 of the points and everyone else scored 8 points each how many players were on her team ?" ; "Let's denote the number of players on Faye's team as <<P>>. Faye scored 28 points, and everyone else scored 8 points each. So, the total number of points scored can be represented as:

<<28 + 8P>>

We know that the total points scored by the team are 68. So, we can set up the equation:

28 + 8P = <<28 + 8P = 68>> 68

Now, let's solve for <<P>>:

Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the term with <<P>>:

8P = <<8P = 68 - 28>> 68 - 28

8P = <<8P = 40>> 40

To find the number of players on Faye's team (<<P>>), we need to divide both sides by 8:

P = <<P = 4 / 08>> 4 / 08

Now, calculate the value of <<P>>:

P = <<P = 5>> 5

So, there were 5 players on Faye's team.
