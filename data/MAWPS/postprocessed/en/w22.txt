Since Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, we can represent the number of marbles Ed had as <<D + 10>>. 

If Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground, we can subtract 11 from the number of marbles Doug had to find the new number of marbles he has: <<D - 11>>. 

Given that Ed had 45 marbles, we can set up an equation: D + 10 = <<D + 10 = 45>> 45. 

To solve for D>>, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: <<D = <<D>>, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: <<D = 45 - 10>> 45 - 10. 

Therefore, Doug had D = <<D = 35>> 35 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had: <<(D + 10) - D>>.

D - 27 = <<D - 27 = E + 9>> E + 9   (Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more marbles)

We can solve these equations to find the values of <<D>> and <<E>>.

First, let's substitute the value of <<E>> from the first equation into the second equation:

D - 27 = <<D - 27 = (D + 24) + 9>> (D + 24) + 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

D - 27 = <<D - 27 = D + 33>> D + 33

According to the given information, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also mentioned that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.

So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes can be represented as ""x + 63"".

The total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is the sum of these two groups: x + (x + 63) = 457.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 63 = 457.

Subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation, we have: 2x = 457 - 63.

Calculating the right side of the equation, we get: 2x = 394.

So, we can set up the equation: x - 22 = <<22 = >> 19. 

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding 22 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - >>22 + <<22 = <<22 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - >>22 + <<22 = >> 19 + <<22.

"the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 12 inches . how much farther did the frog jump than the grasshopper ?" ; "To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance jumped by the grasshopper from the distance jumped by the frog.

Distance jumped by the frog = 12 inches
Distance jumped by the grasshopper = 9 inches

So, the difference in their distances can be calculated as:

Distance jumped by the frog - Distance jumped by the grasshopper = 12 - 9 = 3

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?" ; "The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 49 - 19 = 30.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 24 inches . the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?" ; "To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their respective jumps.

Given:
- The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
- The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog.

Let's calculate the frog's jump first:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
Frog's jump = 24 inches + 33 inches

Now, let's calculate the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 5 inches
Mouse's jump = (24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches

Finally, let's find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by calculating the difference between their jumps:
Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
Difference = [(24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches] - 24 inches

Simplifying the calculations:
Frog's jump = <<24 + 33>>
Mouse's jump = <<(24 + 33) - 5>>
Difference = <<[(24 + 33) - 5] - 24>>

Calculating each step:
Frog's jump = <<57>>
Mouse's jump = <<52>>
Difference = <<28>>

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

"the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 35 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much did they jump altogether ?" ; "Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 35 inches.
2. The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. To find out how much they jumped altogether, we need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped to the distance the frog jumped.

Let's calculate the distance the frog jumped:
- The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 35 + 4 = 39 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total distance they jumped altogether:
- We need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped (35 inches) to the distance the frog jumped (39 inches).
- 35 + 39 = 74

Therefore, they jumped altogether 74 inches.

 tInitial length = << tInitial length = 19 >> 19 

Now, if she grew 18 more inches, we can represent this as:

 tGrowth = << tGrowth = 18 >> 18 

To find the total length of her hair now, we can add the initial length and the growth:

 tTotal length = << tTotal length = tInitial length + tGrowth >> tInitial length + tGrowth 

Substituting the values:

 tTotal length = << tTotal length = 19 + 18 >> 19 + 18

First, let's find the initial difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps. Danny found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. So the initial difference is:

62 - 10 = <<62 - 10 = 52>> 52

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the initial difference from the current difference:

16 - 52 = <<16 - 52 = -36>> -36

The negative value indicates that Danny has 36 fewer wrappers than bottle caps now. However, since the question asks for the absolute value of the difference, we can ignore the negative sign. Therefore, Danny has 36 more wrappers than bottle caps now.

Nell initially had 239 baseball cards and 38 10 cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 10 cards and 111 baseball cards left.

To find the number of 10 cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the current number of 10 cards from the initial number of 10 cards: 38 10 cards - 376 10 cards = -338 10 cards.

To find the number of baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the current number of baseball cards from the initial number of baseball cards: 239 baseball cards - 111 baseball cards = 128 baseball cards.

Paco had 6 salty cookies and ate 34 salty cookies, so he had 6 - 34 = -28 salty cookies left.

To find the difference between the number of salty and sweet cookies Paco ate, we subtract the number of sweet cookies left from the number of salty cookies left: -28 - (-12) = -28 + 12 = -16.

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, we can conclude that Paco didn't eat more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

To find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries after losing 8 pounds, we subtract 8 from the original weight:

Step 1: The problem states that initially there were 22 children on the bus.
 tInitial number of children on the bus = << tInitial number of children on the bus = 22 >> 22 

Step 2: At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus.
 tNumber of children who got on the bus = << tNumber of children who got on the bus = 40 >> 40 

Step 3: After some children got off the bus, there were 2 children remaining on the bus.
 tNumber of children remaining on the bus = << tNumber of children remaining on the bus = 2 >> 2 

Step 4: We need to find how many children got off the bus at the bus stop.
To find this, we can subtract the number of children remaining on the bus from the total number of children who were on the bus initially.
 tNumber of children got off the bus = << tNumber of children got off the bus = tInitial number of children - tNumber of children remaining on the bus >> tInitial number of children - tNumber of children remaining on the bus 

Step 5: Substitute the given values into the equation.
 tNumber of children got off the bus = << tNumber of children got off the bus = 22 - 2 >> 22 - 2

"bryan took a look at his books as well . each bookshelf contains 2 books . if he has a total of 38 books how many bookshelves does he have ?" ; "Let's solve the problem step by step:

1) We know that each bookshelf contains 2 books.
2) Let's assume the number of bookshelves is represented by the variable ""x"".
3) The total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of bookshelves by the number of books per bookshelf, which is 2. So, the equation can be written as:

2 * x = 38

4) To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

(2 * x) / 2 = 38 / 2

5) Simplifying the equation:

x = 19

Therefore, Bryan has 19 bookshelves.

"melissa scored 109 points in each game . she also got 82 bonus points in each game . how many points did she score in 79 games ?" ; "Melissa scored 109 points in each game and got 82 bonus points in each game. To find out how many points she scored in 79 games, we need to multiply the total points scored in each game by the number of games played.

Total points scored in each game = 109 + 82 = 191
Number of games played = 79

To find the total points scored in 79 games, we multiply the total points scored in each game by the number of games played:

Total points scored = 191 * 79

Calculating this, we get:

Total points scored = 15189

"the ferris wheel in paradise park has some seats . each seat can hold 9 people . if 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time how many seats does the ferris wheel have ?" ; "To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we can divide the total number of people who can ride the wheel by the number of people each seat can hold.

Given:
Number of people who can ride the wheel at the same time = 18
Number of people each seat can hold = 9

To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel:
Number of seats = Number of people who can ride the wheel / Number of people each seat can hold

Number of seats = 18 / 9

Calculating the division:
Number of seats = 2

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

15 - 10 = 5x

5 = 5x

To isolate ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

First, let's calculate the total number of cakes Matthew gave to his friends. We know that Matthew initially had 8 cakes and he gave an equal number to each friend. So, the total number of cakes given to friends is <<8 / 4>>.

8 / 4 = <<8 / 4 = 2>> 2

Each friend received 2 cakes.

Since you had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies is given by <<26x>>.

You also had 15 candies, which are not cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies and candies is <<26x + 15>>.

We know that the total number of cookies and candies is 52. So we can set up the equation 26x + 15 = <<26x + 15 = 52>> 52.

To solve for x>>, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: <<26x = <<x>>, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: <<26x = 52 - 15>> 52 - 15.

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us 26x = <<26x = 37>> 37.

To isolate x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26: <<x = <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26: <<x = 3 / 726>> 3 / 726.

Simplifying the fraction gives us x = <<x = 1.42>> 1.42 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, each bag contains approximately 1.42 cookies.

To find the number of bags of cookies you have, we can divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of cookies in each bag (1.42):

52 / 1.42 = <<52 / 1.42 = 36.62>> 36.62 (rounded to two decimal places).

Given that there are 6 storks and 2 birds initially sitting on the fence, we can calculate the total number of storks and birds by adding these two quantities together:

6 + 2 = <<6 + 2 = 8>> 8

So, there are a total of 8 storks and birds on the fence.

Next, we are told that 3 more birds came to join them. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to compare the number of storks to the number of birds after the additional birds arrived.

Since only birds joined, the number of storks remains the same at 6. However, we need to add the additional 3 birds to the initial 2 birds:

2 + 3 = <<2 + 3 = 5>> 5

Therefore, after the additional birds arrived, there are now 5 birds on the fence.

To determine how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

Let's denote the number of pages in the second chapter as ""x"".

We know that:

According to the given information, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed would have ""x + 30"" marbles.

Next, it is mentioned that Ed lost 21 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, the new number of marbles Ed has is ""x + 30 - 21"".

According to the question, we know that Ed had 91 marbles. So we can set up the equation:

x + 30 - 21 = <<x + 30 - 21 = 91>> 91

Simplifying this equation step by step:

x + 9 = <<x + 9 = 91>> 91

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

x = <<x = 82>> 82

Therefore, Doug has 82 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug, we subtract Doug's number of marbles from Ed's:

(x + 30) - x = <<(x + 30) - x = (82 + 30) - 82>> (82 + 30) - 82

Simplifying this expression:

112 - 82 = <<112 - 82 = ####>> ####

According to the given information, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed would have ""x + 12"" marbles.

Then, it is mentioned that Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, Ed would have ""x + 12 - 20"" marbles remaining, which is equal to 17.

To find out how many marbles Doug has now, we need to equate the expression for Ed's remaining marbles to 17 and solve for ""x"".

x + 12 - 20 = <<x + 12 - 20 = 17>> 17

Simplifying the equation:

x - 8 = <<x - 8 = 17>> 17

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 25>> 25

Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now.

Given:
Total number of choices = 66
Number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes = 450
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 38

To find the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we can subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students:

Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon = Number of students who participated in suggesting new food items

Let's calculate it step by step:

Total number of students = Total number of choices
Total number of students = 66

Number of students who participated in suggesting new food items = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon

According to the given information, we know that 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon (x) and 351 students suggested adding only bacon (y).

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to add the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon (x) and the number of students who suggested adding only bacon (y).

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + y.

From the given information, we have:
x = 218
y = 351

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we substitute the values of x and y into the equation:

 tCups of flour needed - tCups of salt needed = << tCups of flour needed - tCups of salt needed = tCups of flour to add now >> tCups of flour to add now 

 12 - 7 = << 12 - 7 = tCups of flour to add now >> tCups of flour to add now 

Simplifying the calculation:

 12 - 7 = << 12 - 7 = 5 >> 5 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour than cups of salt.

"mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour . she already put in some cups of flour . if she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar how many cups of flour did she put in ?" ; "Let's assume the number of cups of flour Mary put in is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the problem, Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, Mary needs 3 + 5 = <<3 + 5 = 8>> 8 cups of flour in total.

We also know that Mary already put in some cups of flour, which is represented by <<x>>. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = <<x + 5 = 8>> 8

To solve for <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = <<x = 8 - 5>> 8 - 5

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, Mary put in 3 cups of flour.

"winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries . there are 18 bird families living near the mountain . if 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia how many bird families flew away for the winter ?" ; "To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia.

Given:
Number of bird families living near the mountain = 18
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 80

To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia:

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = Number of bird families that flew to Africa + Number of bird families that flew to Asia

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = 38 + 80

Calculating this sum, we get:

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = 118

According to the problem, he lost or gave away 315 crayons by the end of the school year. Therefore, the number of crayons he had left can be represented as x - 315.

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can set up the equation:

x - 315 = 291

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 315 to both sides:

Initially, the waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

3 - x = 4

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to solve for ""x"". 

Adding ""x"" to both sides of the equation: 

3 - x + x = 4 + x

Simplifying the equation:

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: 

3 - 4 = 4 + x - 4

-1 = x

Therefore, there is 1 more customer who stayed behind than those that left.

"dan has 2 . he bought some candy bar for 6 each one costing 3 . how many candy bar did he buy ?" ; "To find out how many candy bars Dan bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar.

Dan spent a total of <<6 for each candy bar, and he bought some candy bars. Let's represent the number of candy bars he bought as ""x"".

The total amount Dan spent on candy bars is given by multiplying the cost of each candy bar (>>6) by the number of candy bars he bought (x):

Total amount = <<6 * x

We also know that each candy bar costs >>3. So, we can set up an equation:

<<6 * x = Total amount
>>3 * x = Total amount

Since both equations represent the same thing, we can equate them:

6 * x = <<6 * x = >> 3 * x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by <<3:

(>>6 * x) / 3 = <<3 = (>> (3 * x) / $3
2x = x

Now, we have found that 2x = x. This means that Dan bought 2 candy bars.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 = 62 books left.

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:
(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:
108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:
73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73

2. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase.
3. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
4. After all these actions, there are now 23 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses and the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 2
Number of roses thrown away = 4
Total number of roses in the vase = 23

So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can use the following equation:

 tTotal number of roses = << tTotal number of roses = tInitial number of roses + tNumber of roses cut - tNumber of roses thrown away >> tInitial number of roses + tNumber of roses cut - tNumber of roses thrown away 

Substituting the given values:

Now, let's find out how many flowers grew in each flower bed. We are given that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of flowers by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of flowers that grew in each bed:

 tTotal number of flowers = << tTotal number of flowers = tNumber of flower beds * tNumber of flowers that grew in each bed >> tNumber of flower beds * tNumber of flowers that grew in each bed 

Let's calculate it step by step:

 tNumber of flower beds = << tNumber of flower beds = 5 / 515 = 3.6667 >> 5 / 515 = 3.6667  (rounded to four decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fraction or decimal value for the number of flower beds, we will round it down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 3 flower beds.

The mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, so the total number of junk mails given to all blocks is 2 * (number of blocks).

Since each block contains ""x"" houses, the total number of blocks is equal to the total number of houses divided by ""x"".

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

Let's assign variables to the unknown quantities:
- Let A represent the number of apples Adam has.
- Let J represent the number of apples Jackie has.

From the given information, we can form equations:

1. ""Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie."" can be written as A = J + 4.
2. ""Jackie has 10 apples."" can be written as J = 10.
3. ""Together Adam and Jackie have 2 apples."" can be written as A + J = 2.

"for the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks . if large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails . how many nails does john need for the house wall ?" ; "To find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the number of nails required for the large planks and the small planks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. We know that each large plank requires 15 nails to be secured, and John is using 12 large planks. So, we can multiply these two numbers to find the total number of nails needed for the large planks:

 15 * 12 = << 15 * 12 = 180 >> 180 

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks. We are given that each small plank requires 5 nails to be secured, and John is using 10 small planks. So, we can multiply these two numbers to find the total number of nails needed for the small planks:

 5 * 10 = << 5 * 10 = 50 >> 50 

Finally, we can add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks together to find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall:

Given that each plank needs 74 pieces of nails, and John needs 8 planks, we can calculate the total number of nails required as follows:

Total number of nails = Number of nails per plank * Number of planks
Total number of nails = 74 * 8

Calculating this expression, we find:

Total number of nails = 592

Therefore, John needs 592 nails for the house wall. To determine the number of planks he needs, we divide this total by the number of nails needed per plank:

Number of planks = Total number of nails / Number of nails per plank
Number of planks = 592 / 74

Calculating this expression, we find:

Number of planks = 8

Hence, John needs 8 planks for the house wall.

Let's denote the number of hours Julia spent playing tag with 19 kids on Monday as \( x \) hours, and the number of hours she spent playing tag with 18 kids on Tuesday as \( y \) hours. We know that the total time she spent playing tag on both days is 38 hours. So, we can write the following equation:

\[ x + y = 38  t(1) \]

We also know that she played tag with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday. We need to find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday. Let's denote this difference as \( z \). We can write another equation based on the number of kids she played with:

\[ 19 - 18 = z  t(2) \]

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

From equation (1), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 38 - x \]

Substituting this into equation (2), we can solve for \( z \):

\[ 19 - 18 = 38 - x \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ x = 21 \]

Now that we know the value of \( x \), we can find the value of \( y \) using equation (1):

\[ y = 38 - x = 38 - 21 = 17 \]

Finally, we can find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday (\( z \)):

1. Jerry initially had some action figures on his shelf.
2. He added 2 more action figures.
3. He also removed 7 of the old ones.
4. Now, there are 10 action figures on his shelf.

We need to find out how many action figures Jerry had initially.

Let's use algebraic reasoning with << symbols to represent the initial number of action figures.

Jerry's initial number of action figures + 2 (added) - 7 (removed) = 10 (current total)

So, we can express this as an equation:

>> Initial + 2 - 7 = 10 <<

Now, let's solve for Initial.

>> Initial - 5 = 10 <<

To isolate Initial, add 5 to both sides of the equation.

>> Initial = 10 + 5 <<

Now, calculate the value of Initial.

>> Initial = 15 $

He still has <<3>> books.

To calculate that, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:
6 - 3 = <<6 - 3 = 3>> 3

Given that there are 2 chapters across 23 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find the average number of pages per chapter. 

 tAverage number of pages per chapter = << tAverage number of pages per chapter = 2 / 32 = 11.5 >> 2 / 32 = 11.5 

Since we know that the first chapter is 10 pages long, we can subtract this value from the average to find the number of pages in the second chapter.

 tNumber of pages in second chapter = << tNumber of pages in second chapter = tAverage number of pages per chapter - tNumber of pages in first chapter = 11.5 - 10 = 1.5 >> tAverage number of pages per chapter - tNumber of pages in first chapter = 11.5 - 10 = 1.5

Let's assume the number of pages of reading homework Rachel had to complete is \( R \). According to the second statement, the number of pages of math homework she had to complete is \( R + 4 \) since she had to complete 4 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

Now, we know that she completed a total of 7 pages of math homework. Using the given information, we can write the equation:

\[ R + (R + 4) = 7 \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ 2R + 4 = 7 \]
\[ 2R = 3 \]
\[ R = 1.5 \]

So, Rachel had to complete \( d1.5 \) pages of reading homework.

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 24 inches . the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?" ; "Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference in the distances they jumped.

First, let's find out how far the frog jumped:

 Frog's\,Jump = << Frog's\,Jump = Grasshopper's\,Jump + 33 >> Grasshopper's\,Jump + 33 

 Frog's\,Jump = << Frog's\,Jump = 24 + 33 = 57\,inches >> 24 + 33 = 57\,inches 

Now, let's find out how far the mouse jumped:

 Mouse's\,Jump = << Mouse's\,Jump = Frog's\,Jump - 5 >> Frog's\,Jump - 5 

 Mouse's\,Jump = << Mouse's\,Jump = 57 - 5 = 52\,inches >> 57 - 5 = 52\,inches 

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper:

 Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = << Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = Mouse's\,Jump - Grasshopper's\,Jump >> Mouse's\,Jump - Grasshopper's\,Jump 

 Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = << Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = 52 - 24 = 28\,inches >> 52 - 24 = 28\,inches

You mentioned that the grasshopper jumped both 13 inches and 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, which doesn't make sense. I assume you meant to say the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and you want to find out how far the frog jumped.

If the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can calculate the distance the frog jumped by adding 13 inches (grasshopper's jump) to the 2 inches:

13 + 2 = <<13 + 2 = 15>> 15

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 39 inches . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?" ; "Let's solve this step by step:

Let's denote the distance the frog jumped as <<F>>.

According to the information given:

- The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, which means the grasshopper's jump is <<F + 19>> inches.
- The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse's jump is <<F - 12>> inches.

We know the grasshopper's jump is 39 inches. So we have the equation:

F + 19 = <<F + 19 = 39>> 39

Solving for <<F>>:

F = <<F = 39 - 19 = 20>> 39 - 19 = 20 inches.

Now, we can find the distance the mouse jumped using the value of <<F>>:

F - 12 = <<F - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8>> 20 - 12 = 8 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Now, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. So, we can calculate the frog's jump first and then subtract 3 inches to find the mouse's jump.

Grasshopper's jump: <<9>> inches
Frog's jump: 33>> inches + Grasshopper's jump = <<33>> inches + Grasshopper's jump = <<33 + 9>> <<33 + 9 inches

1. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar.
2. Mary has already added some cups of flour.
3. She still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

We can represent the amount of flour Mary has already added as ""F"" cups, and the amount of sugar as ""S"" cups. According to the problem, she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, so we can write an equation for this:

 F = << F = S + 8 >> S + 8 

Now, let's consider the total amount of flour needed according to the recipe, which is 6 cups. We can express this as:

 F = << F = 6 >> 6 

And the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups, which can be represented as:

 S = << S = 13 >> 13 

Now, we have a system of equations:

1.  F = << F = S + 8 >> S + 8 
2.  F = << F = 6 >> 6 
3.  S = << S = 13 >> 13 

We can substitute the values of F and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

 6 = << 6 = 13 + 8 >> 13 + 8 

Now, we need to solve for the number of cups of flour needed. Subtract 13 from both sides:

 6 - 13 = << 6 - 13 = 13 + 8 - 13 >> 13 + 8 - 13 

 -7 = << -7 = 8 - 13 >> 8 - 13 

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:

To find out how many customers left, we need to determine how many customers he had before the 99 new customers arrived. We can do this by subtracting the 99 new customers from the 5 customers he had.

5 - 99 = <<5 - 99 = -94>> -94

So, the waiter had -94 customers before the 99 new customers arrived. Since it's not possible to have a negative number of customers, we can conclude that no customers left; instead, he gained 99 new customers.

1. Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park.
2. He threw away 51 old ones.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to determine his initial collection before he found the 63 bottle caps at the park.

Initial collection + Found at the park - Threw away = Final collection

Let's represent this with equations:

Let C represent Danny's initial collection.

C + 63 (found at the park) - 51 (threw away) = 33 (final collection)

Now, we can solve for C:

C + 63 - 51 = 33

First, let's calculate the initial total number of cards:

Initial total cards = Total baseball cards + Total 10 cards
Initial total cards = 246 (baseball cards) + 214 (10 cards)

Now, we know Nell gave some cards to Jeff, so we'll calculate the final total cards:

Final total cards = Total baseball cards left + Total 10 cards left
Final total cards = 404 (baseball cards left) + 495 (10 cards left)

To find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the final number of baseball cards from the final number of 10 cards:

Let's do the calculations:

Initial total cards = 246 + 214 = 460
Final total cards = 404 + 495 = 899

"paco had 26 salty cookies and 17 sweet cookies . he ate 14 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies . how many salty cookies did paco have left ?" ; "Certainly! Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of salty cookies:** Paco had 26 salty cookies.
2. **Initial number of sweet cookies:** Paco had 17 sweet cookies.
3. **Cookies eaten:** Paco ate 14 sweet cookies and 9 salty cookies.

So together they can fill 8 * 36 = <<8 * 36 = 288>> 288 drums of grapes per day.

The question asks: how many days will it take to fill <<240>> drums of grapes?

We need to find the number of days it will take <<36>> pickers filling <<288>> drums of grapes per day to fill <<240>> drums of grapes.

We can set up a proportion:

240>> drums of grapes / <<x>> days of work  = <<240>> drums of grapes / <<x>> days of work  = <<288>> <<288 drums of grapes / <<1>> day of work

Solving for <<x>>:

x>> = <<x>> = <<240>> <<240 drums of grapes / (<<288>> drums of grapes / <<1>> day of work)

x>> = <<x>> = <<240>> <<240 / <<288>> 

x>> = <<x>> = <<0.8333...>> <<0.8333... days

So it will take <<0.83>> days or approximately <<8>> hours for <<36>> pickers filling <<288>> drums of grapes per day to fill <<240>> drums of grapes.

- John will use 12 large planks.
- Each large plank needs 14 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is <<12 * 14>>.

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks:
- John will use 17 small planks.
- Each small plank needs 25 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is <<17 * 25>>.

Now, we can add the number of nails needed for both the large and small planks to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = (<<12 * 14>>) + (<<17 * 25>>)

Now, let's calculate this expression:

Total nails needed = <<168 + 425>>

Now, we can add these two values together to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = 168 + 425 = <<168 + 425 = 593>> 593

So, John needs 593 nails for the house wall. Now, to find the total number of planks, we can divide this number by the number of nails needed for each plank, which is 14 for large planks and 25 for small planks:

Total planks needed = <<c59314 + 25>>
Total planks needed = <<c59339>>

Now, let's calculate this division:

Total planks needed ≈ 15.2051 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

So, John needs approximately 15.2051 planks for the house wall. Since you can't have a fraction of a plank, he will need 16 planks for the house wall.

2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, which means David did <<15 + 39>> push-ups.
3. John did 9 push-ups less than David, which means John did <<(15 + 39) - 9>> push-ups.

Now, we can calculate the number of push-ups each person did:

- Zachary: <<15>> push-ups
- David: 15 + 39 = <<15 + 39 = 54>> 54 push-ups
- John: (15 + 39) - 9 = <<(15 + 39) - 9 = 45>> 45 push-ups

Finally, let's find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John:

15 - 45 = <<15 - 45 = -30>> -30 ####. 

Since a negative value doesn't make sense in this context (you can't do negative push-ups), we'll take the absolute value:

|-30| = <<|-30| = 30>> 30 ####.

Therefore, Zachary did 30 more push-ups than John.

1. David did 27 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 5 (Zachary's push-ups) + 27 = 32 push-ups.
2. David did 7 less crunches than Zachary, so David did 17 (Zachary's crunches) - 7 = 10 crunches.

Now, let's calculate how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did:

1. Zachary did 17 crunches.
2. Zachary did 5 push-ups.
3. To find how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did, we subtract the number of push-ups from the number of crunches: 17 (crunches) - 5 (push-ups) = 12 more crunches than push-ups.

So, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups.####

3. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
4. After all these actions, there are now 15 roses in the vase.

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to calculate the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Jessica had after throwing away 34 roses:
21 - 34 = <<21 - 34 = -13>> -13

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, this means that Jessica must have cut more roses from her garden than she threw away. 

To find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut, we need to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two quantities. In this case, it would be the absolute value of -13, which is 13.

Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold = 126 - 115 = <<126 - 115 = 11>> 11
Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold = 48 - 81 = <<48 - 81 = -33>> -33

Now, to find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we subtract the number of pastries from the number of cakes:

11 - (-33) = <<11 - (-33) = 11 + 33 = 44>> 11 + 33 = 44

So, Baker made 44 more cakes than pastries.

"matthew gave equal numbers of crackers and cakes to his 28 friends . if he had 13 crackers and 15 cakes initially how many crackers and cakes did each person eat ?" ; "To find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate, we need to divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends.

Let's start by finding the total number of crackers and cakes that Matthew gave to his friends. Since he gave an equal number of crackers and cakes, we can add the number of crackers and cakes together.

Total number of crackers and cakes = 13 (crackers) + 15 (cakes) = 28

Now, we can divide the total number of crackers and cakes by the number of friends to find out how many crackers and cakes each person ate.

Number of crackers and cakes each person ate = Total number of crackers and cakes / Number of friends = 28 / 28 = 1

Therefore, each person ate 1 cracker and 1 cake.

after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the buckingham palace on the previous day . if there were 246 visitors on that day how many visited the buckingham palace within 25 days ?

<<703>> visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.
<<246>> visitors came on that day.
We need to find the total visitors within <<25>> days.

Let's call the number of visitors on the remaining <<24>> days as <<x>>.  

Then, total visitors = visitors on that day + visitors on previous day + visitors on remaining <<24>> days

Let's represent the total number of eggs as ""E"" and the number of eggs in each group as ""G.""

<< E >> divided by << G >> will give us the number of groups, and then we can multiply that by the number of eggs in each group to find the total number of eggs.

So, the calculation is:
 E / G = << E / G = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * G = << tNumber of groups * G = tTotal number of eggs >> tTotal number of eggs 

In this case:
 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups
