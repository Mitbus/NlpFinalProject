In the first week, he walks 10 miles.
In the second week, he walks 10 + 2 = 12 miles.
In the third week, he walks 12 + 2 = 14 miles.
And so on...

We can see that the distance increases by 2 miles each week. So, we can use a formula to calculate the total distance walked by the 8th week.

The formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series is:
 S_n = << S_n = n / 2(a_1 + a_n) >> n / 2(a_1 + a_n) 

Where:
<< S_n >> is the sum of the series,
<< n >> is the number of terms in the series,
<< a_1 >> is the first term in the series, and
<< a_n >> is the last term in the series.

In this case, we have:
 n = << n = 8 >> 8  (since we want to find out how many miles he walks by the 8th week),
 a_1 = << a_1 = 10 >> 10  (the first term is 10 miles), and
 a_n = << a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d >> a_1 + (n-1)d  (where << d >> is the common difference between terms).

Since the common difference between terms is 2 miles, we can substitute these values into our formula:

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + (8-1)2) >> 8 / 2(10 + (8-1)2) 

Simplifying further:

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + 7  2) >> 8 / 2(10 + 7  2) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + 14) >> 8 / 2(10 + 14) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(24) >> 8 / 2(24) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 4  24 >> 4  24 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 96 >> 96

1. Ashley sold 12 boxes of Samoas.
2. To find out how many cases of 12 boxes she needs, you can divide the number of boxes sold by 12.
    12 / 12 = << 12 / 12 = 1 >> 1 
   This tells us that she needs at least 1 case of 12 boxes.

3. To determine how many extra boxes she needs beyond the full case, you can use the modulo operator (%), which gives the remainder when dividing by 12.
    12 % 12 = << 12 % 12 = 0 >> 0

Based on the study results , how many woman in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35 would likely be married 2 or more times ?" ; "To solve this problem, we can use proportions. We know that 8 out of 100 women over the age of 35 were married 2 or more times in the random sample. We want to find out how many women out of 5,000 would likely be married 2 or more times based on this sample.

We can set up a proportion:

8 / 100} = <<8 / 100} = x / 5000}>> x / 5000}

To solve for 'x', we can cross-multiply:

8 * 5000 = <<8 * 5000 = 100 * x>> 100 * x

Now, calculate the right side:

40000 = <<40000 = 100x>> 100x

To solve for 'x', divide both sides by 100:

4 / 0000}100 = <<4 / 0000}100 = 1 / 00x}100>> 1 / 00x}100

Simplify:

400 = <<400 = x>> x

So, in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35, approximately 400 of them would likely be married 2 or more times based on the study results.

"The number of gears a machine can make varies directly by how long it operates . If it can make 2088 gears in 8 hours , How many gears can it make in 9 hours ?" ; "To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the concept of direct variation.

Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is represented by ""x"" and the number of hours it operates is represented by ""y"".

According to the problem, we know that when the machine operates for 8 hours, it can make 2088 gears. We can write this as:

x / y = <<x / y = 2 / 088}8>> 2 / 088}8

To find out how many gears the machine can make in 9 hours, we need to solve for ""x"" when ""y"" is equal to 9. We can set up a new proportion using this information:

x / 9 = <<x / 9 = 2 / 088}8>> 2 / 088}8

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply and then divide:

8x = <<8x = 2088 * 9>> 2088 * 9

8x = <<8x = 18792>> 18792

x = <<x = 1 / 8792}8>> 1 / 8792}8

x = <<x = 2349>> 2349

"Bianca 's team won their dodgeball game and scored 75 points total . If Bianca scored 45 of the points and everyone else scored 6 points each , how many players were on her team ?" ; "Let's denote the number of players on Bianca's team as << P >>.

Bianca scored 45 points, and everyone else scored 6 points each. So the total number of points can be calculated as follows:
 45 + 6P = << 45 + 6P = 75 >> 75 

Now, let's isolate the variable << P >> by subtracting 45 from both sides of the equation:
 6P = << 6P = 75 - 45 >> 75 - 45 

Next, we'll subtract 45 from 75 to find the total points scored by the rest of the team:
 6P = << 6P = 30 >> 30 

Now, to find the number of players (<< P >>), we can divide both sides of the equation by 6:
 P = << P = 3 / 06 >> 3 / 06 

Simplifying the right side:
 P = << P = 5 >> 5 

So, there were 5 players on Bianca's team.

Here is my step-by-step solution to the math problem:

```
Marie starts with 95 erasers.  <<95>>
She loses 42 erasers.      <<42>>
```
To solve this problem, we need to subtract the number of erasers Marie loses from the number of erasers she starts with:

```

The Rate for First Minute is 0.4698 , the Rate for Additional Minutes is 0.374 , and the Total Minutes are 17 . How much is the bill ?" ; "To calculate the phone bill, we need to determine the cost for the first minute and the cost for additional minutes, and then multiply them by the total number of minutes.

The rate for the first minute is given as 0.4698. To find the cost for the first minute, we multiply this rate by 1 (since it's only one minute):
 0.4698 * 1 = << 0.4698 * 1 = 0.4698 >> 0.4698 

The rate for additional minutes is given as 0.374. To find the cost for additional minutes, we multiply this rate by the total number of additional minutes, which is obtained by subtracting 1 from the total number of minutes:
 0.374 * (17 - 1) = << 0.374 * (17 - 1) = 0.374 * 16 = 5.984 >> 0.374 * 16 = 5.984 

Now, we add the cost for the first minute and the cost for additional minutes to get the total bill:
 0.4698 + 5.984 = << 0.4698 + 5.984 = 6.4538 >> 6.4538 

Therefore, the phone bill sent to Boston on June 16 is $6.4538.

Tiffany baked 8 brownies, and she used 8 cups of flour for each one, so she used:
8 t brownies * 8 t cups of flour per brownie = <<8 t brownies * 8 t cups of flour per brownie = 64>> 64 cups of flour for the brownies she baked.

Tiffany needed 17 brownies for her party, so she still needs:
17 t total brownies needed - 8 t brownies she baked = <<17 t total brownies needed - 8 t brownies she baked = 9>> 9 more brownies.

Now, to find out how much flour she needs for the remaining 9 brownies, we can calculate:

"Jacqueline has 4 boxes of erasers . Each box holds 10 erasers and there are 9 boxes in a case . How many erasers does Jacqueline have ?" ; "To find out how many erasers Jacqueline has, we can break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many erasers are in a case.
Each case has 9 boxes, and each box holds 10 erasers, so to find the number of erasers in a case, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of erasers in each box:

 9 * 10 = << 9 * 10 = 90 >> 90 

Step 2: Find out how many cases Jacqueline has.
Jacqueline has 4 boxes of erasers. We need to find out how many cases that is. Since there are 9 boxes in a case, we can divide the number of boxes Jacqueline has by the number of boxes in a case to find out how many cases she has:

 4 / 9 = << 4 / 9 = 0.4444... >> 0.4444... 

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we need to round down to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a case. Therefore, Jacqueline has 0 cases.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of erasers Jacqueline has.
Now that we know Jacqueline has 0 cases, we can calculate the total number of erasers she has by multiplying the number of cases by the number of erasers in each case (which we found in Step 1):

 0 * 90 = << 0 * 90 = 0 >> 0 

So, Jacqueline has 0 erasers.

"A store had 120 coloring books in stock . They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 39 of them . The put the ones they still had onto shelves with 9 on each shelf . How many shelves did they use ?" ; "Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. The store initially had 120 coloring books in stock.
2. They got rid of 39 of them, so they had 120 - 39 coloring books left.

Now, we need to find out how many shelves they used, with 9 coloring books on each shelf. To do this, we'll divide the remaining number of coloring books by the number of books on each shelf:

3. Number of shelves = (Remaining coloring books) / (Books on each shelf)
4. Number of shelves = (120 - 39) / 9

Now, we can perform the calculations:

1. Connie had some marbles.
2. She gave 73 marbles to Juan.
3. Now she has 70 marbles left.
4. We need to find out how many marbles she had to start with.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:
Let ""X"" be the number of marbles Connie had to start with.

X (Connie's initial marbles) - 73 (marbles given to Juan) = 70 (marbles Connie has left)

Now, we can solve for X:

X - 73 = 70

To isolate X, we can add 73 to both sides of the equation:

X - 73 + 73 = 70 + 73
X = 143

So, Connie had 143 marbles to start with.

"On a recent trip to CA , we averaged 50 miles per hour . On the return trip we averaged 60 miles per hour . Determine the average speed of the trip to CA and back ." ; "To determine the average speed of the trip to California and back, we can use the formula for the average speed of two journeys with different speeds. The formula is:

Average Speed = 2 * (Speed1 * Speed2) / (Speed1 + Speed2)

In this case, Speed1 is 50 miles per hour (the speed to California), and Speed2 is 60 miles per hour (the speed on the return trip). Let's calculate it step by step.

1. Calculate the product of the two speeds:
   50 * 60 = <<50 * 60 = 3000>> 3000

2. Calculate the sum of the two speeds:
   50 + 60 = <<50 + 60 = 110>> 110

3. Calculate 2 times the product divided by the sum:
   2 * 3 / 000}110 = <<2 * 3 / 000}110 = 6 / 000}110>> 6 / 000}110

4. Simplify the fraction:
   6 / 000}110 = <<6 / 000}110 = 3 / 000}55>> 3 / 000}55

Now, we can calculate the actual average speed.

5. Calculate the average speed:

"A waiter had 44 customers in his section . If 12 of them left and the rest of his tables had 8 people at each table , how many tables did he have ?" ; "Let's solve this step by step.

Initially, the waiter had 44 customers in his section. After 12 of them left, he was left with 44 - 12 = 32 customers.

Now, we know that the rest of the tables had 8 people at each table. So, the total number of people seated at these tables is the number of tables multiplied by 8. We can represent this as:

Total number of people = Number of tables * 8

Since the total number of people is 32, we can set up the equation:

32 = Number of tables * 8

To find the number of tables, we can rearrange this equation to solve for the number of tables.

Number of tables = 32 / 8

Number of tables = 4

So, the waiter had 4 tables in his section.

How many total games are played in one season ?" ; "In the Cook County Regional Football League, there are 10 teams. Each team plays every other team twice, once at home and once away. To find out how many total games are played in one season, we can break it down step by step.

Step 1: Calculate the number of games one team plays in one season.
- Each team plays every other team twice (once at home and once away).
- This means each team plays 10 - 1 = 9 other teams twice.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of games for one team in one season.
- Each team plays 9 other teams twice.
- So, the number of games for one team = 9 * 2.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of games for all 10 teams in one season.
- Since there are 10 teams, we multiply the number of games for one team by 10.

Let's calculate it step by step:

Step 1: 9 * 2 = <<9 * 2 = 18>> 18 (number of games for one team)
Step 2: 18 * 10 = <<18 * 10 = 180>> 180 (number of games for all 10 teams)

So, there are 180 total games played in one season in the Cook County Regional Football League.

"Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables for her house . If she spent 8 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together , how many minutes did it take her to finish ?" ; "To find out how many minutes it took Maria to finish putting together the furniture, we need to calculate the total time spent on each piece of furniture and then add them up.

Maria bought 2 new chairs and 2 new tables. Since she spent 8 minutes on each piece of furniture, we can multiply 8 by the number of chairs and tables she bought.

Now, we can solve for the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" using cross-multiplication:

3 * 3 pounds = <<3 * 3 pounds = >> 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

9 pounds = 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

To find the cost for 3 pounds of apples, we need to isolate the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 75:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 pounds) / 75

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 pounds of apples:

Cost for 3 pounds = 9 / 75

Simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 / 3) / (75 / 3)

Cost for 3 pounds = 3 / 25

"Fred has 110 blue marbles . Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim . How many blue marbles does Tim have ?" ; "Let's use algebra to solve this problem step by step. 

Let B represent the number of blue marbles Tim has. 

According to the information given, Fred has 110 blue marbles, and Fred has 22 times more blue marbles than Tim. So, we can express this relationship as:

Fred's blue marbles = Tim's blue marbles + 22 * Tim's blue marbles

We are given that Fred has 110 blue marbles, so we can write this equation as:

110 = B + 22B

Now, let's combine like terms:

110 = 1B + 22B

Now, we can simplify this equation:

1B + 22B = 23B

So, 23B = 110

Now, we can solve for B by dividing both sides by 23:

B = 110 / 23

Now, let's calculate B:

B = <<B = 1 / 10}23>> 1 / 10}23

How many bouncy balls did Maggie buy in all ?" ; "Maggie bought 4 packs of red bouncy balls, 8 packs of yellow bouncy balls, and 4 packs of green bouncy balls. Since there were 10 bouncy balls in each package, we can find the total number of bouncy balls by multiplying the number of packs by the number of balls in each pack.

For the red bouncy balls, Maggie bought 4 packs, so the total number of red bouncy balls is 4 * 10 = <<4 * 10 = 40>> 40.

For the yellow bouncy balls, Maggie bought 8 packs, so the total number of yellow bouncy balls is 8 * 10 = <<8 * 10 = 80>> 80.

For the green bouncy balls, Maggie bought 4 packs, so the total number of green bouncy balls is 4 * 10 = <<4 * 10 = 40>> 40.

To find the total number of bouncy balls Maggie bought in all, we can add the number of red, yellow, and green bouncy balls together.

40 + 80 + 40 = <<40 + 80 + 40 = 160>> 160

Therefore, Maggie bought a total of 160 bouncy balls.

"A pet shelter had 3 puppies when another 3 were brought in . If 3 puppies a day are adopted , how long would it take for all of them to be adopted ?" ; "Initially, the pet shelter had 3 puppies. Then, another 3 puppies were brought in. So, the total number of puppies in the shelter is 3 + 3 = 6.

If 3 puppies are adopted each day, we can calculate how many days it would take for all of them to be adopted by dividing the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day.

Total number of puppies = 6
Number of puppies adopted per day = 3

To find the number of days, we divide the total number of puppies by the number of puppies adopted per day:

Number of days = Total number of puppies / Number of puppies adopted per day
Number of days = 6 / 3

Simplifying this division, we have:

Number of days = 2

Therefore, it would take 2 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

We know that Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each. If there were <<x>> players on Emily's team, then the total points scored by everyone else would be <<(x-1) * 2>>, since Emily is not included in the everyone else category. 

The total points scored by Emily and everyone else is given as 39. So we can write the equation:

23 + (x-1) * 2 = <<23 + (x-1) * 2 = 39>> 39

Simplifying the equation:

23 + 2(x-1) = <<23 + 2(x-1) = 39>> 39

23 + 2x - 2 = <<23 + 2x - 2 = 39>> 39

2x + 21 = <<2x + 21 = 39>> 39

Subtracting 21 from both sides:

2x = <<2x = 18>> 18

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = <<x = 9>> 9

Therefore, there were 9 players on Emily's team.

Step 1: Determine how many whole boxes Nathan ate:
Nathan ate 20 gumballs, and each box contains 5 gumballs, so we can find the number of whole boxes he ate by dividing the total number of gumballs he ate by the number of gumballs per box:
 20 / 5 = << 20 / 5 = 4 >> 4  whole boxes.

Step 2: Calculate how many gumballs he has left:
To find out how many gumballs Nathan has left, we need to subtract the gumballs he ate from the total number of gumballs:
 Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = << Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = Total\,gumballs - 20 >> Total\,gumballs - 20 

Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs Nathan has left:
If we assume that Nathan started with a certain number of gumballs, let's call it ""X,"" then we can express the equation as:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs >> Left\,gumballs 

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gumballs in a box and the total number of gumballs Nathan has left:
Each box contains 5 gumballs, and Nathan ate 4 whole boxes, so we can calculate the total number of gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate:
 4 * 5 = << 4 * 5 = 20 >> 20  gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate.

Step 5: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now, we can use the equation from step 3 to calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs >> Left\,gumballs 

Step 6: Find the value of X (the total number of gumballs Nathan started with):
 X = << X = Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 >> Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 

So, Nathan started with 40 gumballs.

Step 7: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now that we know he started with 40 gumballs, we can use the equation from step 5 to find out how many gumballs he has left:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 >> Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 

Nathan has 20 gumballs left.

The answer is:
Nathan ate 4 whole boxes of gumballs, and he has 20 gumballs left.

So, in the second week, he walks 10 + 2 miles, in the third week, he walks 10 + 2 + 2 miles, and so on. This is an arithmetic sequence.

To find how many miles he walks by the 8th week, we can calculate the sum of the first 8 terms of this arithmetic sequence.

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:

Sum = (n/2) * [2 * a + (n - 1) * d]

Where:
- Sum is the sum of the first n terms.
- n is the number of terms.
- a is the first term.
- d is the common difference between the terms.

In this case, the first term (a) is 10 miles, the common difference (d) is 2 miles, and we want to find the sum of the first 8 terms (n = 8).

Let's plug these values into the formula:

Sum = (8/2) * [2 * 10 + (8 - 1) * 2]

Sum = 4 * [20 + 7 * 2]

Now, calculate the expression inside the brackets:

Sum = 4 * (20 + 14)

"Mrs. Hilt is baking bread . She needs 5 cups of flour to bake 2 loaves of bread . How much flour will she need to make one loaf of bread ?" ; "To find out how much flour Mrs. Hilt needs to make one loaf of bread, we can set up a proportion. We know that she needs 5 cups of flour to make 2 loaves, so we can represent this as a ratio:

5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = <<5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}>> x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}

Now, we can solve for <<x>>, which represents the amount of flour needed for one loaf of bread. We can cross-multiply to find <<x>>:

5 * 1 = <<5 * 1 = 2 * x>> 2 * x

Simplifying further:

5 = <<5 = 2x>> 2x

To isolate <<x>>, we can divide both sides by 2:

x = <<x = 5 / 2>> 5 / 2

So, Mrs. Hilt will need <<5 / 2>> cups of flour to make one loaf of bread.

Now, let's calculate the value of <<5 / 2>>:

5 / 2 = <<5 / 2 = 2.5>> 2.5

So, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make one loaf of bread.

1. The pet shelter initially had 17 puppies.
2. Another 55 puppies were brought in, so now they have a total of 17 + 55 puppies.
3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can set up an equation. We need to find the number of days it takes for the total number of puppies to reach zero.

Starting with the total number of puppies:
Total = <<Total = 17 + 55>> 17 + 55

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. Let's call this ""d"" (the number of days).

Each day, 8 puppies are adopted, so we can subtract 8 for each day:
Total - 8d = <<Total - 8d = 0>> 0

Now, we can solve for ""d"" to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted:
17 + 55 - 8d = <<17 + 55 - 8d = 0>> 0

72 - 8d = <<72 - 8d = 0>> 0

8d = <<8d = 72>> 72

To isolate ""d,"" we can divide both sides by 8:

By what percent would his petroleum bill be changed ?" ; "To find the percent change in the consumer's petroleum bill after the price of petroleum oil went up by 10% and the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percent, we can use the following steps:

1. Let's assume the original price of petroleum oil is <<100, and the original oil consumption is 100 units for simplicity. This is just an arbitrary choice to make the calculations easier.

2. After the price of petroleum oil went up by 10%, the new price is >>110 (<<100 + 10% of >>100).

3. The consumer reduces oil consumption by 10%, which means they now consume 90 units of oil (100 units - 10% of 100 units).

4. To calculate the new petroleum bill, we multiply the new price by the new consumption: 110 * 90 = <<110 * 90 = >> 9900.

5. Now, let's calculate the percent change in the petroleum bill. We'll compare the new bill of <<9900 to the original bill of >>10000.

Percent Change = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100
Percent Change = ((<<9900 - >>10000) / <<10000) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percent change:

Percent Change = ((>>9900 - 10000) / >>10000) * 100 = <<10000) / >>10000) * 100 = (-<<100 / >> (-<<100 / 10000) * 100 = -1%

So, the consumer's petroleum bill would be changed by a decrease of 1%.

"Ellen had 380 legos , but Ellen lost 57 of them . How many legos does Ellen have now ?" ; " ```
<<380>>

Ellen originally had <<380>> legos.

She then lost <<57>> of them. 

To calculate how many legos Ellen has now, we subtract the <<57>> legos she lost from the <<380>> legos she originally had.

380 - 57 = <<380 - 57 = 323>> 323

Therefore, Ellen has <<323>> legos now.

"A waiter had 14 customers to wait on . If 3 customers left and he got another 39 customers , how many customers would he have ?" ; "The waiter initially had 14 customers. After 3 customers left, he had 14 - 3 customers, and then if he got another 39 customers, he would have 14 - 3 + 39 customers.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Initial number of customers: 14.
2. Number of customers who left: 3.
3. Number of new customers he got: 39.

Now, we'll calculate the final number of customers:

Initial customers - Customers who left + New customers
= 14 - 3 + 39

Now, we can perform the calculations:

= 14 - 3 + 39
= 11 + 39

= 50

So, the waiter would have 50 customers.

"Mary had 33 Pokemon cards , and 6 were torn . Sam gave Mary 23 new Pokemon cards . How many Pokemon cards does Mary have now ?" ; "Mary initially had 33 Pokemon cards, and 6 of them were torn. This means Mary had 33 - 6 = 27 Pokemon cards that were not torn.

Next, Sam gave Mary 23 new Pokemon cards. To find out how many Pokemon cards Mary has now, we simply need to add the number of Pokemon cards she had before to the number of new cards she received.

So, we have:

27>> (Mary's initial cards) + <<23>> (new cards from Sam) = <<27>> (Mary's initial cards) + <<23>> (new cards from Sam) = <<50>> <<50

Mary now has 50 Pokemon cards.

"The schools debate team had 28 boys and 4 girls on it . If they were split into groups of 4 how many groups could they make ?" ; "To find out how many groups can be made from the 28 boys and 4 girls when split into groups of 4, we need to perform division.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of students.
Total number of students = 28 boys + 4 girls
Total number of students = 32 students

Step 2: Calculate how many groups of 4 students can be made.
Number of groups = Total number of students / Number of students in each group
Number of groups = 32 students / 4 students per group

Now, perform the division:

Number of groups = 32 / 4
Number of groups = 8

So, they can make 8 groups.

"Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled . If she had 11 bags , but did n't recycle 2 of them , how many points would she have earned ?" ; "Wendy earned 5 points for each bag of cans she recycled. If she had 11 bags but didn't recycle 2 of them, we can calculate the total points she would have earned by multiplying the number of bags recycled by 5.

Total points = 11 bags (recycled) * 5 points per bag

Now, let's calculate:

 11 * 5 = << 11 * 5 = 55 >> 55 

Wendy would have earned 55 points if she had recycled all 11 bags.

"Lena drove 204 miles . Using 10 gallons of gas at this rate , how many gallons of gas would she need to drive 255 miles ?" ; "To find out how many gallons of gas Lena would need to drive 255 miles at the same rate, we can set up a proportion. We know that she drove 204 miles using 10 gallons of gas, so we can write:

204>> miles / <<10>> gallons = <<204>> miles / <<10>> gallons = <<255>> <<255 miles / <<x>> gallons

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for <<x>>:

204 * x = <<204 * x = 10 * 255>> 10 * 255

204x = <<204x = 2550>> 2550

Now, divide both sides by 204 to isolate <<x>>:

x = <<x = 2 / 550}204>> 2 / 550}204

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

x = <<x = 2 / 5  102}2  102>> 2 / 5  102}2  102

x = <<x = 2 / 52>> 2 / 52

So, Lena would need <<25/2>> or 12.5 gallons of gas to drive 255 miles at the same rate.

"A furniture store has a chair , originally priced at 78 dollars , on sale for 46 dollars . What is the percent of decrease , rounded to the nearest tenth ?" ; "To find the percent decrease, you can use the following formula:

\[
tPercent Decrease = \ / textOriginal Price - tSale Price}t{Original Price} * 100
\]

Given:
- Original Price = <<78
- Sale Price = >>46

Let's plug these values into the formula:

\[
tPercent Decrease = 7 / 8 - 46}78 * 100
\]

Now, calculate the numerator:

\[
78 - 46 = 32
\]

Now, plug this value back into the formula:

\[
tPercent Decrease = 3 / 278 * 100
\]

Now, calculate the fraction:

\[
3 / 278 = 0.41025641025641024
\]

Now, multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[
0.41025641025641024 * 100 = 41.03
\]

So, the percent of decrease, rounded to the nearest tenth, is approximately 41.0%.
