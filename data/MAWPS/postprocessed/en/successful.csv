If Bobby had 22 pieces of candy and he ate some pieces, then he would have 22 - x pieces of candy left.

After eating 5 more pieces, he would have (22 - x) - 5 pieces of candy left.

According to the problem, he still has 8 pieces of candy left, so we can set up the equation:

(22 - x) - 5 = 8

Simplifying the equation:

22 - x - 5 = 8

Given that the first chapter is 37 pages long (x = <<x = 37>> 37) and the second chapter is 80 pages long (y = <<y = 80>> 80), we can calculate the difference between them by subtracting <<x>> from <<y>>.

y - x = <<y - x = 80 - 37>> 80 - 37

Simplifying this expression:

y - x = <<y - x = 43>> 43

Therefore, the second chapter has 43 more pages than the first chapter.

60 + x = <<60 + x = 93>> 93

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 60 from both sides:

x = <<x = 93 - 60>> 93 - 60

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 33>> 33

Therefore, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.

a book has 2 chapters . the second chapter is 36 pages long . if there are a total of 67 pages in the book how many pages are in the first chapter ?,"Let's assume the number of pages in the first chapter is represented by the variable << x >>. 

We know that the second chapter is 36 pages long, so we can write this as an equation:  36 = << 36 = x + 36 >> x + 36 . 

Since there are a total of 67 pages in the book, we can also write this as an equation:  67 = << 67 = x + 36 >> x + 36 . 

To find the number of pages in the first chapter, we need to solve for << x >>. 

Subtracting 36 from both sides of the equation  67 = << 67 = x + 36 >> x + 36  gives us:  67 - 36 = << 67 - 36 = x + 36 - 36 >> x + 36 - 36 . Simplifying this equation gives us:  31 = << 31 = x >> x . 

Therefore, there are 31 pages in the first chapter.

rachel 's tree had 4 apples initially . she picked some apples and now there are 2 apples left on the tree . how many apples did rachel pick ?,"Let's denote the number of apples Rachel picked as ""x"". 

Initially, Rachel had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some apples, so the number of apples left on the tree is given by subtracting the number of apples she picked from the initial number of apples: 4 - x.

According to the problem, there are now 2 apples left on the tree. So we can set up an equation: 4 - x = 2.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation by isolating ""x"" on one side:

4 - x = 2
-x = 2 - 4
-x = -2

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-2)
x = 2

Therefore, Rachel picked 2 apples.

rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree . now the tree has 5 apples still on it . if 3 of those are ripe and the rest are unripe how many unripe apples does the tree have now ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. Rachel picked 7 ripe apples from her tree.
2. The tree now has 5 apples still on it.
3. Out of those 5 apples, 3 are ripe.

To find out how many unripe apples are left on the tree, we need to subtract the number of ripe apples from the total number of remaining apples.

Total remaining apples = 5
Ripe apples = 3

Unripe apples = Total remaining apples - Ripe apples

Substituting the values:
Unripe apples = 5 - 3

Calculating:
Unripe apples = 2

Therefore, the tree has 2 unripe apples now.

To find the initial number of apples on the tree, we can set up an equation:

x - 6 (ripe apples picked) = 2 (remaining ripe apples) + 4 (remaining unripe apples)

Simplifying this equation:

x - 6 = 2 + 4

Combining like terms:

x - 6 = 6

Adding 6 to both sides of the equation:

x = 12

Therefore, the tree initially had 12 apples.

The problem states that after Rachel picked the apples, there are now 2 ripe apples left on the tree. So we can set up the equation:

x - 3 = <<x - 3 = 2>> 2

To find the initial number of ripe apples, we need to solve for ""x"". Adding 3 to both sides of the equation gives us:

x = <<x = 2 + 3>> 2 + 3

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 5>> 5

Therefore, the tree initially had 5 ripe apples.

According to the given information, Ed had 2 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 2) marbles.

Doug lost some of his marbles at the playground, so his total number of marbles decreased by a certain amount. Let's represent this amount as y.

After losing some marbles, Doug's new total is (x - y).

Now, it is stated that Ed has 19 more marbles than Doug. So we can set up the equation:

(x + 2) = (x - y) + 19

Simplifying this equation:

x + 2 = x - y + 19
2 - y = 19
-y = 17

Let's say Doug initially had D marbles and Ed initially had E marbles.

According to the problem, Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug, so we can write an equation: E = D + 24.

Next, it is mentioned that Doug lost 27 of his marbles at the playground. So now Doug has D - 27 marbles.

Then, it is stated that Ed found 9 more marbles. So now Ed has E + 9 marbles.

We need to find how many more marbles Ed has than Doug after these changes. This can be calculated by subtracting the number of marbles Doug has from the number of marbles Ed has: (E + 9) - (D - 27).

Substituting E = D + 24 into the equation, we get: (D + 24 + 9) - (D - 27).

Simplifying this expression, we have: D + 33 - D + 27.

Combining like terms, we get: 60.

Therefore, Ed has 60 more marbles than Doug after these changes.

Next, we are told that Ed lost 17 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, the number of marbles Ed had after losing them would be (x + 29) - 17.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug then, we need to subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had after losing them. So the calculation would be ((x + 29) - 17) - x.

Simplifying this expression, we get (x + 12) - x.

The x terms cancel out, leaving us with just 12.

Therefore, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug after losing 17 of his marbles at the playground.

there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase . how many roses did she cut ?,"Let's assume that Jessica cut <<x>> roses and <<y>> orchids from her flower garden.

Initially, there were 13 roses and 84 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 91 orchids and 14 roses in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 13 + x = <<13 + x = 14>> 14
This equation represents the number of roses after Jessica cut some from her garden.

Equation 2: 84 + y = <<84 + y = 91>> 91
This equation represents the number of orchids after Jessica cut some from her garden.

Simplifying Equation 1, we have:
x = <<x = 14 - 13>> 14 - 13
x = <<x = 1>> 1

Simplifying Equation 2, we have:
y = <<y = 91 - 84>> 91 - 84
y = <<y = 7>> 7

Therefore, Jessica cut 1 rose from her flower garden.

there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase . how many orchids did she cut ?,"Let's assume that Jessica cut <<x>> orchids from her flower garden. 

Initially, there were 3 orchids in the vase, and after cutting some more, there are now 7 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the number of orchids Jessica cut can be calculated as:

3 + x = <<3 + x = 7>> 7

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 7 - 3>> 7 - 3

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 4>> 4

So, Jessica cut 4 orchids from her flower garden.

there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase . how many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Initially, there were 6 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.
2. Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden.
3. Now, there are 21 orchids and 22 roses in the vase.
4. We need to find out how many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now.

To solve this, we can subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses.

Number of roses - Number of orchids = Number of more roses than orchids

So, let's calculate that:

22 - 21 = <<22 - 21 = 1>> 1

Therefore, there is 1 more rose than orchid in the vase now.

robin cut off 20 inches of her hair . if her hair is now 10 inches long how long was her hair before she cut ?,"Let's assume that the length of Robin's hair before she cut it is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, Robin cut off 20 inches of her hair. Therefore, the remaining length of her hair after cutting is <<x - 20>>.

It is also mentioned that her hair is now 10 inches long. So we can set up the equation:

x - 20 = <<x - 20 = 10>> 10

To find the value of <<x>>, we can add 20 to both sides of the equation:

x - 20 + 20 = <<x - 20 + 20 = 10 + 20>> 10 + 20

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x = <<x = 30>> 30

Therefore, Robin's hair was originally 30 inches long before she cut it.

#### 30"
robin cut off 13 inches of her hair . if her hair was 14 inches long initially how long is her hair now ?,"To find out how long Robin's hair is now, we need to subtract the length of hair she cut off from her initial hair length.

josh had 9 marbles in his collection . he lost some marbles . if he has 4 marbles now how many marbles did he lose ?,"Let's denote the number of marbles Josh lost as ""x"". 

Initially, Josh had 9 marbles in his collection. If he lost ""x"" marbles, then the remaining number of marbles can be calculated by subtracting ""x"" from 9. 

So, the equation becomes: 9 - x = <<9 - x = 4>> 4. 

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides: 9 - x - 4 = <<9 - x - 4 = 4 - 4>> 4 - 4. 

Simplifying the equation gives us: 5 - x = <<5 - x = 0>> 0. 

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 5 from both sides: 5 - x - 5 = <<5 - x - 5 = 0 - 5>> 0 - 5. 

Simplifying further gives us: -x = <<-x = -5>> -5. 

To solve for ""x"", we can multiply both sides by -1: -1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-5)>> -1 * (-5).

According to the problem, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 22 pounds together. So we can write the equation:

M + D = <<M + D = 22>> 22

On the way back, Marco's dad found an additional 30 pounds of strawberries. This means that Marco's strawberries now weigh <<M>> pounds, and his dad's strawberries weigh <<D + 30>> pounds. We are also given that Marco's strawberries now weigh a total of 36 pounds. So we can write another equation:

M + (D + 30) = <<M + (D + 30) = 36>> 36

We can solve this system of equations to find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries.

First, let's simplify the second equation:

M + D + 30 = <<M + D + 30 = 36>> 36

Next, let's substitute the value of <<M>> from the first equation into the second equation:

(22 - D) + D + 30 = <<(22 - D) + D + 30 = 36>> 36

Simplifying further:

52 - D = <<52 - D = 36>> 36

Now, let's isolate <<D>> by subtracting 52 from both sides:

-D = <<-D = -16>> -16

Finally, let's solve for <<D>> by multiplying both sides by -1:

D = <<D = 16>> 16

- At the bus stop, some more children got on the bus.
- After the bus stop, there were 10 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many more children are on the bus now than before the bus stop, we need to determine the difference between the number of children after the bus stop and the number of children before the bus stop.

The number of children before the bus stop was 2. The number of children after the bus stop is 10.

To find the difference, we subtract the initial number from the final number:

According to the problem, ""at the bus stop 2 more children got on the bus."" This means that after these 2 children got on, the total number of children on the bus became <<41>>. 

We can express this information in an equation: x + 2 = <<x + 2 = 41>> 41. 

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation: 

x + 2 - 2 = <<x + 2 - 2 = 41 - 2>> 41 - 2

Initially, there were 21 children on the bus. Then, 10 children got off the bus. So, the number of children remaining on the bus is 21 - 10 = <<21 - 10 = 11>> 11.

After some more children got on the bus at the bus stop, there were a total of 16 children on the bus. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

11 + x = <<11 + x = 16>> 16

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 11 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 16 - 11>> 16 - 11

Simplifying this expression gives us:

x = <<x = 5>> 5

Therefore, 5 children got on the bus at the bus stop.

matthew had 15 crackers . if matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left how many crackers did each friend eat ?,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of division. Matthew started with 15 crackers and gave an equal number of crackers to his 5 friends. We need to find out how many crackers each friend ate.

Let's denote the number of crackers each friend ate as ""x"". So, Matthew gave away a total of 5 * x crackers to his friends. After giving away these crackers, Matthew had 10 crackers left.

We can express this situation with the following equation: 15 - (5 * x) = 10.

Now, let's solve the equation step by step:

1. Subtract 10 from both sides: 15 - (5 * x) - 10 = 10 - 10.

Simplifying the left side gives us: 5 - (5 * x) = 0.

2. Rearrange the equation: - (5 * x) + 5 = 0.

3. Subtract 5 from both sides: - (5 * x) + 5 - 5 = 0 - 5.

Simplifying the left side gives us: - (5 * x) = -5.

4. Divide both sides by -5: (-5 * x) / -5 = -5 / -5.

Simplifying the left side gives us: x = 1.

So, each friend ate 1 cracker.

Let's represent the number of days she drank for as ""d"". 

The total number of bottles she bought is 301, and she has 157 bottles left. So, the number of bottles she drank can be calculated by subtracting the number of bottles left from the total number of bottles bought: 

301 - 157 = 144

We know that Debby drank 144 bottles a day for ""d"" days. So, the total number of bottles she drank can be calculated by multiplying the number of bottles she drank per day (144) by the number of days (d):

144 * d = 144d

Since we know that Debby drank a total of 144 bottles, we can set up an equation:

144d = 144

To find the value of ""d"", we can divide both sides of the equation by 144:

(144d)/144 = 144/144

Simplifying this equation gives us:

d = 1

Therefore, Debby drank for 1 day.

5 red peaches and 11 green peaches are in the basket . how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket ?,"To find out how many more green peaches than red peaches are in the basket, we need to subtract the number of red peaches from the number of green peaches.

Let's denote the number of red peaches as R and the number of green peaches as G.

We are given that there are 5 red peaches, so R = 5.
We are also given that there are 11 green peaches, so G = 11.

To find the difference between the number of green peaches and red peaches, we subtract R from G: G - R.

Substituting the values, we have 11 - 5 = 6.

Therefore, there are 6 more green peaches than red peaches in the basket.

10 red peaches and some more green peaches are in the basket . if there are a total of 15 peaches in the basket how many green peaches are in the basket ?,"Let's assume the number of green peaches in the basket is represented by the variable << g >>. We are given that there are 10 red peaches, so the total number of peaches can be expressed as << 10 + g >>. 

According to the problem, the total number of peaches in the basket is 15. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

 10 + g = << 10 + g = 15 >> 15 

To find the value of << g >>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

 g = << g = 15 - 10 >> 15 - 10 

Simplifying the right side gives us:

 g = << g = 5 >> 5 

Hence, there are 5 green peaches in the basket.

there are 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets . if each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches how many baskets of peaches are there ?,"To find the number of baskets of peaches, we need to divide the total number of peaches by the number of peaches in each basket.

Given that each basket has 4 red peaches and 6 green peaches, there are a total of 4 + 6 = 10 peaches in each basket.

Let's denote the number of baskets as ""x"". Therefore, the total number of peaches can be calculated as x * (4 + 6) = 10x.

Since we know that there are a total of 10 peaches distributed equally in some baskets, we can set up the equation:

10x = 10

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 10:

10x/10 = 10/10

This simplifies to:

x = 1

Therefore, there is only one basket of peaches.

He then added 7 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures on the shelf is x + 7.

We are given that there are a total of 10 action figures on his shelf now, so we can set up the equation:

x + 7 = 10

To find the value of x, we can subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

x + 7 - 7 = 10 - 7

x = 3

Therefore, Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.

ed had 10 more marbles than doug . doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 45 marbles how many more marbles did ed have than doug then ?,"Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the given information.

Let's assume that Doug initially had x marbles. According to the problem, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had (x + 10) marbles.

Next, we are told that Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground. After losing these marbles, Doug would have (x - 11) marbles.

We are also given that Ed had 45 marbles. So we can set up the equation:

(x + 10) = 45

Now, let's solve for x to find out how many marbles Doug initially had:

x + 10 = 45
Subtracting 10 from both sides:
x = 35

Therefore, Doug initially had 35 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can substitute the value of x into our equation:

(x + 10) - (x - 11)

Simplifying this expression:
x + 10 - x + 11
Combining like terms:
21

So, Ed had 21 more marbles than Doug.

edward had 13 . he spent some money . now he has 3 . how much money did edward spend ?,"Let's assume Edward spent <<x. 

Initially, Edward had >>13. After spending some money, he now has <<3. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

>>13 - x = 3 

To find the value of x, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: 

<<13 - x - 3 = 3 - 3 

Simplifying the equation: 

>>10 - x = 0 

To isolate x, we can subtract <<10 from both sides of the equation: 

>>10 - x - 10 = <<10 = 0 - >> 0 - 10 

Simplifying the equation: 

-x = -<<10 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

- The grasshopper jumped 14 inches.
- The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.
- The frog jumped 37 inches farther than the grasshopper.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their jumps. 

Let's denote the distance jumped by the mouse as M>> and the distance jumped by the frog as <<F>>. We already know that <<F = <<M>> and the distance jumped by the frog as <<F>>. We already know that <<F = G + 37>> G + 37, where <<G>> represents the distance jumped by the grasshopper.

We also know that M = <<M = F - 16>> F - 16, as the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

Substituting the value of <<F>> from the first equation into the second equation, we get:

M = <<M = (G + 37) - 16>> (G + 37) - 16

Simplifying this expression, we have:

M = <<M = G + 21>> G + 21

Therefore, the mouse jumped 21 inches farther than the grasshopper.

jake has 9 fewer peaches than steven and 18 more peaches than jill . steven has 16 peaches . how many more peaches does steven have than jill ?,"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's represent the number of peaches Jill has as ""Jill's peaches"".
2. We know that Jake has 9 fewer peaches than Steven. So, Jake's peaches can be represented as ""Steven's peaches - 9"".
3. We also know that Jake has 18 more peaches than Jill. So, Jake's peaches can be represented as ""Jill's peaches + 18"".
4. We are given that Steven has 16 peaches. So, Steven's peaches can be represented as 16.

Now, let's use the given information to find the number of peaches Jill has.

We know that Jake's peaches and Steven's peaches are equal, except Jake has 9 fewer peaches. So we can set up an equation:

""Steven's peaches - 9 = Jill's peaches + 18""

Substituting the given values:

""16 - 9 = Jill's peaches + 18""

Simplifying the equation:

""7 = Jill's peaches + 18""

To isolate Jill's peaches, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

""7 - 18 = Jill's peaches""

Simplifying further:

""-11 = Jill's peaches""

Therefore, Jill has -11 peaches.

Now, let's calculate how many more peaches Steven has than Jill:

""Steven's peaches - Jill's peaches = 16 - (-11)""

Simplifying the calculation:

""16 + 11 = 27""

So, Steven has 27 more peaches than Jill.

jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones . if there are 6 action figures on his shelf now how many action figures did he remove from the shelf ?,"Let's assume that Jerry removed x action figures from the shelf.

Initially, Jerry had 3 action figures on the shelf.
He then added 4 more action figures, resulting in a total of 3 + 4 = 7 action figures on the shelf.
After removing some action figures, there are now 6 action figures on the shelf.

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 7 - x = 6.

To solve for x, we can subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:
7 - x - 6 = 6 - 6,

rachel picked 7 apples from her tree . thereafter 2 new apples grew on the tree . now the tree has 6 apples still on it . how many apples did the tree have to begin with ?,"Let's denote the number of apples the tree had to begin with as ""x"". 

According to the information given, Rachel picked 7 apples from the tree, so the number of apples remaining on the tree is ""x - 7"". 

Afterward, 2 new apples grew on the tree, so the number of apples on the tree became ""(x - 7) + 2"". 

Finally, it is stated that the tree now has 6 apples still on it, so we can set up the equation: 

""(x - 7) + 2 = 6"". 

To solve for x, we can simplify the equation: 

""x - 7 + 2 = 6"", 

which can be further simplified to: 

""x - 5 = 6"". 

To isolate x, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation:

rachel has 3 apples trees . she picked 8 apples from each of her trees . now the trees have a total 9 apples still on them . how many apples were there on all trees initially ?,"Let's denote the number of apples on each tree initially as <<x>>. Since Rachel has 3 apple trees, the total number of apples on all trees initially can be calculated by multiplying the number of apples on each tree by the number of trees, which is <<3x>>. 

Rachel picked 8 apples from each tree, so the total number of apples she picked is 3 * 8 = <<3 * 8 = 24>> 24. 

After picking the apples, there were 9 apples still on the trees. Therefore, we can set up the equation 3x - 24 = <<3x - 24 = 9>> 9 to represent the situation. 

To find the initial number of apples on all trees, we need to solve this equation for <<x>>. 

Adding 24 to both sides of the equation, we get 3x = <<3x = 33>> 33. 

Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 3, we find that x = <<x = 11>> 11. 

Therefore, there were initially 11 apples on each tree, and the total number of apples on all trees was 3 * 11 = <<3 * 11 = 33>> 33.

paul had 71 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones . if he has 116 books now how many more books did he buy than he sold ?,"Sure, let's solve the math problem step by step.

Let's assume that Paul initially sold ""x"" books in the garage sale.

So, after selling ""x"" books, the number of books Paul had was 71 - x.

Then, he bought 38 new books, which means the total number of books he had became (71 - x) + 38.

According to the problem, the total number of books Paul has now is 116. So we can set up the equation:

(71 - x) + 38 = 116

Now, let's solve this equation to find the value of ""x"".

Combining like terms, we have:

71 - x + 38 = 116

Adding the numbers on the left side, we get:

109 - x = 116

To isolate ""x"", we subtract 109 from both sides:

- x = 116 - 109

Simplifying, we have:

- x = 7

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides by -1:

x = -7

Now, we need to find the difference between the number of books Paul bought and the number of books he sold. 

The number of books he bought is 38.

The number of books he sold is -7 (since he sold more books than he bought).

To find the difference, we calculate:

38 - (-7)

Simplifying, we have:

38 + 7 = 45

So, Paul bought 45 more books than he sold.

there were 2 roses in the vase . jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase . there are now 23 roses in the vase . how many roses did she cut ?,"Let's assume that Jessica cut x roses from her flower garden.

Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 4 roses, which means the number of roses decreased by 4. After that, she cut some more roses from her garden and put them in the vase. Now, there are 23 roses in the vase.

So, we can set up the equation: 

2 - 4 + x = 23

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation.

First, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

-2 + x = 23

Next, let's isolate x by adding 2 to both sides of the equation:

-2 + x + 2 = 23 + 2
x = 25

Therefore, Jessica cut 25 roses from her flower garden.

dave had 24 apps and 9 files on his phone . after deleting some apps and files he had 5 files and 12 apps left . how many more apps than files does he have left on the phone ?,"Let's start by finding out how many apps and files Dave deleted from his phone. We can do this by subtracting the number of remaining apps and files from the initial number of apps and files.

Initial number of apps = 24
Remaining number of apps = 12

Initial number of files = 9
Remaining number of files = 5

To find the number of deleted apps, we subtract the remaining number of apps from the initial number of apps:
Deleted apps = Initial number of apps - Remaining number of apps = 24 - 12 = 12

To find the number of deleted files, we subtract the remaining number of files from the initial number of files:
Deleted files = Initial number of files - Remaining number of files = 9 - 5 = 4

Now, let's calculate how many more apps than files Dave has left on his phone. We can do this by subtracting the remaining number of files from the remaining number of apps:

More apps than files = Remaining number of apps - Remaining number of files = 12 - 5 = 7

Therefore, Dave has 7 more apps than files left on his phone.

josh had 4 marbles in his collection . he lost 16 marbles and found 8 new ones . how many more marbles did he lose than those he found ?,"To find the number of marbles Josh lost more than those he found, we need to subtract the number of marbles he found from the number of marbles he lost.

Given that Josh had 4 marbles in his collection, lost 16 marbles, and found 8 new ones, we can calculate the difference as follows:

Number of marbles lost = 16
Number of marbles found = 8

To find the difference, we subtract the number of marbles found from the number of marbles lost:

 16 - 8 = << 16 - 8 = 8 >> 8 

Therefore, Josh lost 8 more marbles than the ones he found.

22 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus . then there were 2 children altogether on the bus . how many children got off the bus at the bus stop ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 22 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus.
3. Let's assume that x children got off the bus at the bus stop.
4. After some children got off, there were 2 children left on the bus.
5. Therefore, we can write the equation: 22 + 40 - x = 2.

To find the value of x, we can solve this equation:

22 + 40 - x = 2
62 - x = 2
-x = 2 - 62
-x = -60

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-60)
x = 60

Therefore, 60 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

The total number of cakes Baker had initially is given as 149 cakes. 

Baker sold 10 cakes, so we subtract 10 from the initial number of cakes:
 149 - 10 = << 149 - 10 = 139 >> 139 

Therefore, Baker would still have 139 cakes. 

#### 139"
baker made 14 cakes and 153 pastries . if he sold 8 pastries and 97 cakes how many more cakes than pastries did baker sell ?,"To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker sold, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold.

Given:
Number of cakes made = 14
Number of pastries made = 153
Number of pastries sold = 8
Number of cakes sold = 97

To calculate the difference between the number of cakes and pastries sold, we can subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold:

Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold = Difference

97 - 8 = Difference

Calculating the difference:

97 - 8 = <<97 - 8 = 89>> 89

Therefore, Baker sold 89 more cakes than pastries.

jesse needs a carpet of size 10 square feet to cover her room . if her room is 2 feet wide what is the length of her room ?,"To find the length of Jesse's room, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: 

Area = Length × Width

We know that the area of the room is 10 square feet and the width is 2 feet. Let's substitute these values into the formula:

10 = Length × 2

To solve for the length, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

10/2 = Length × 2/2

Simplifying:

5 = Length

Therefore, the length of Jesse's room is 5 feet.

in haley 's class 11 are boys who love to play marbles . if haley gives 9 marbles to each boy how many marbles did she have ?,"Let's denote the number of boys in Haley's class as ""b"". According to the given information, there are 11 boys who love to play marbles. Therefore, we can write the equation:

b = 11

Haley gives 9 marbles to each boy. So, the total number of marbles she gives away is:

9 * b

To find out how many marbles Haley had initially, we need to subtract the number of marbles she gave away from her initial total. Let's denote the initial number of marbles as ""m"". The equation becomes:

m - (9 * b)

Since we want to find the value of ""m"", we can set it equal to zero and solve for ""m"":

m - (9 * b) = 0

Now, let's substitute the value of ""b"" from the first equation into the second equation:

m - (9 * 11) = 0

Simplifying this equation gives us:

m - 99 = 0

To isolate ""m"", we add 99 to both sides of the equation:

m = 99

Therefore, Haley initially had 99 marbles.

This can be represented as:

 x = << x = 406 - 132 >> 406 - 132 

Simplifying this equation:

 x = << x = 274 >> 274 

Therefore, there were 274 visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.

6 birds and 3 storks were sitting on the fence . 2 more storks came to join them . how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence ?,"To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence, we first need to determine the total number of birds and storks on the fence. 

Given that there are 6 birds and 3 storks initially sitting on the fence, we can calculate the total number of birds and storks by adding these two quantities together:

6 + 3 = <<6 + 3 = 9>> 9

So, initially, there are a total of 9 birds and storks on the fence. 

Next, we need to consider the additional 2 storks that came to join them. To find out how many more birds than storks are sitting on the fence now, we need to subtract the number of storks from the number of birds.

Since there were initially 6 birds and now there are still 6 birds (no additional birds joined), we can subtract the number of storks from this quantity:

6 - (3 + 2) = <<6 - (3 + 2) = 6 - 5 = 1>> 6 - 5 = 1

Therefore, there is only 1 more bird than stork sitting on the fence now.

david did 51 push-ups in gym class today . david did 49 more push-ups than zachary . how many push-ups did zachary and david do altogether ?,"Let's assume the number of push-ups Zachary did is represented by the variable << Z >>. 

According to the information given, David did 49 more push-ups than Zachary. Therefore, the number of push-ups David did can be represented as << Z + 49 >>. 

We are also told that David did a total of 51 push-ups. So we can set up an equation: 

 Z + 49 = << Z + 49 = 51 >> 51 

To find the value of << Z >>, we can subtract 49 from both sides of the equation: 

 Z = << Z = 51 - 49 >> 51 - 49 

Simplifying the right side gives us: 

 Z = << Z = 2 >> 2 

So Zachary did 2 push-ups. 

To find out how many push-ups Zachary and David did altogether, we can add their individual totals: 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 2 + (2 + 49) >> 2 + (2 + 49) 

Simplifying this expression gives us: 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 2 + 51 >> 2 + 51 

 Z + (Z + 49) = << Z + (Z + 49) = 53 >> 53 

Therefore, Zachary and David did a total of 53 push-ups altogether.

According to the given information, we know that Steven has 14 more peaches than Jill, so we can write an equation as:

S = <<S = Jill + 14>> Jill + 14

We also know that Steven has 15 peaches, so we can substitute <<S>> with 15 in the equation:

15 = <<15 = Jill + 14>> Jill + 14

To find out how many peaches Jill has, we need to solve this equation. Subtracting 14 from both sides gives us:

15 - 14 = <<15 - 14 = Jill>> Jill

Simplifying the left side gives us:

1 = <<1 = Jill>> Jill

So, Jill has 1 peach.

Now, we know that Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven. We can represent this relationship with another equation:

J = <<J = S - 7>> S - 7

Substituting <<S>> with 15 (since Steven has 15 peaches) in the equation gives us:

J = <<J = 15 - 7>> 15 - 7

Simplifying the right side gives us:

J = <<J = 8>> 8

To find out how many minutes the machine worked today, we need to determine the difference in the number of shirts made between yesterday and today.

The machine made 9 shirts yesterday and 8 shirts today, so the difference is 9 - 8 = 1 shirt.

Since the machine can make 2 shirts per minute, we can divide the difference in shirts made by the machine's production rate to find the number of minutes it worked today.

1 shirt / 2 shirts per minute = 0.5 minutes.

Therefore, the machine worked for 0.5 minutes today.

danny collects bottle caps and wrappers . he found 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers at the park . now he has 11 wrappers and 12 bottle caps in his collection . how many more bottle caps than wrappers does danny have now ?,"To find out how many more bottle caps than wrappers Danny has now, we need to subtract the number of wrappers from the number of bottle caps.

Danny initially found 58 bottle caps and 25 wrappers at the park. So, the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers at the park is:

58 - 25 = <<58 - 25 = 33>> 33

Now, we need to consider the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny currently has in his collection. He has 11 wrappers and 12 bottle caps. So, the difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers in his collection is:

12 - 11 = <<12 - 11 = 1>> 1

To find the total difference between the number of bottle caps and wrappers Danny has now, we add the difference from the park to the difference from his collection:

33 + 1 = <<33 + 1 = 34>> 34

Therefore, Danny has 34 more bottle caps than wrappers now.

baker made 134 pastries and 11 cakes . if he sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries how many more pastries than cakes did baker make ?,"To find out how many more pastries than cakes Baker made, we need to calculate the difference between the number of pastries and cakes he made.

Baker initially made 134 pastries and 11 cakes. 
He then sold 140 cakes and 92 pastries.

To determine the difference, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made, and subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made.

Number of pastries made: 134
Number of cakes made: 11

Number of cakes sold: 140
Number of pastries sold: 92

Difference in pastries: 134 - 92 = <<134 - 92 = 42>> 42
Difference in cakes: 11 - 140 = <<11 - 140 = -129>> -129

Since we are interested in the difference in pastries than cakes, we disregard the negative sign for the difference in cakes.

Therefore, Baker made 42 more pastries than cakes.

41 campers went rowing and 4 campers went hiking in the morning . 26 campers went rowing in the afternoon . how many campers went rowing and hiking in all ?,"To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we need to add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon.

Given:
Number of campers who went rowing in the morning = 41
Number of campers who went hiking in the morning = 4
Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon = 26

To find the total number of campers who went rowing and hiking in all, we add the number of campers who went rowing in the morning and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon:

Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = Number of campers who went rowing in the morning + Number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon
Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = 41 + 26

Calculating this expression gives us:

Total number of campers who went rowing and hiking = 67

ed had 12 more marbles than doug . ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 17 marbles how many marbles does doug have now ?,"Let's assume that Doug has x marbles.
According to the given information, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had x + 12 marbles.
Ed lost 20 marbles at the playground, so the number of marbles Ed has now is (x + 12) - 20.
We are also given that Ed has 17 marbles, so we can set up the equation:
(x + 12) - 20 = 17
Simplifying the equation:
x + 12 - 20 = 17
x - 8 = 17
Adding 8 to both sides of the equation:
x - 8 + 8 = 17 + 8
x = 25
Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now.

because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . if 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon while 351 suggested adding only bacon to the menu how many students suggested adding bacon ?,"Let's assume that the number of students who suggested adding bacon is represented by the variable <<x>>.

According to the given information, 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon, and 351 students suggested adding only bacon to the menu.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

<<x>> (students who suggested adding bacon) + 218 (students who suggested adding mashed potatoes and bacon) = 351 (students who suggested adding only bacon)

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 218 from both sides of the equation:

<<x>> = 351 - 218

Now we can calculate the value of <<x>>:

<<x>> = 133

Therefore, 133 students suggested adding bacon.

a mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block . if the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block . how many houses are there in a block ?,"To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given in the problem statement.

The mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block. If the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, this means he is giving a total of 2 * 14 = 28 junk mails to each block.

Therefore, if we let <<x>> represent the number of houses in a block, we can set up the following equation:

14x = <<14x = 28>> 28

To solve for <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 14:

x = <<x = 28 / 14>> 28 / 14

This will give us the number of houses in a block.

at the zoo a cage had snakes and alligators . the total number of animals in the cage was 79 . if 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding how many animals were not hiding in all ?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the information given in the problem statement and apply simple arithmetic operations.

The total number of animals in the cage is 79. This is the sum of all the animals, regardless of whether they are hiding or not. We also know that 24 snakes and 51 alligators were hiding, meaning they were not visible. 

We can calculate the number of alligators and snakes that were not hiding by subtracting the number of hiding alligators and snakes from the total number of each. 

For the alligators, we subtract the number of hiding alligators from the total number of alligators:

 51 - 24 = << 51 - 24 = 27 >> 27 

For the snakes, we subtract the number of hiding snakes from the total number of snakes:

 24 - 24 = << 24 - 24 = 0 >> 0 

Since there are no snakes that were not hiding, this makes sense. 

Therefore, there were 27 alligators and 0 snakes that were not hiding. 

So, the answer is:

dave had 15 apps on his phone . he added 71 new apps . after deleting some he had 14 left . how many more apps did he delete than he added ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

Dave initially had 15 apps on his phone.
He added 71 new apps.
After deleting some apps, he was left with 14 apps.

To find out how many more apps Dave deleted than he added, we need to calculate the difference between the number of apps he deleted and the number of apps he added.

Let's represent the number of apps Dave deleted as ""x"".

The total number of apps Dave had after adding new apps is given by:
15 + 71 = 86

Since he ended up with 14 apps after deleting some, we can set up the equation:
86 - x = 14

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 14 from both sides of the equation:
86 - x - 14 = 14 - 14
72 - x = 0

Now, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 72 from both sides of the equation:
72 - x - 72 = 0 - 72
-x = -72

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 (to get rid of the negative sign):
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-72)
x = 72

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 more apps than he added.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar . she already put in 5 cups of flour . how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now ?,"To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the cups of flour and the cups of sugar in the cake recipe. 

The recipe calls for 14 cups of flour and 6 cups of sugar. Mary has already put in 5 cups of flour. 

First, we need to calculate how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of flour she has already added from the total amount of flour needed in the recipe. 

 14 - 5 = << 14 - 5 = 9 >> 9 

So, Mary needs to add 9 more cups of flour.

Next, we need to calculate how many more cups of sugar Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of sugar in the recipe from the amount of sugar already added (which is the same as the amount of flour added because the recipe calls for the same amount of flour and sugar). 

 6 - 5 = << 6 - 5 = 1 >> 1 

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of sugar.

Finally, we need to find out how many more cups of flour than sugar Mary needs to add. This is calculated by subtracting the amount of sugar from the amount of flour.

there were 3 dollars in olivia 's wallet . she collected 49 more dollars from an atm . after she visited a supermarket there were 49 dollars left . how much more money did she collect at the atm than she spent at the supermarket ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

Olivia initially had 3 dollars in her wallet.
She collected 49 more dollars from an ATM.
After visiting a supermarket, she had 49 dollars left.

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we need to calculate the difference between the amount she collected and the amount she had left.

Amount collected at the ATM = Initial amount + Amount collected = <<3 + >>49 = <<52
Amount spent at the supermarket = Amount collected - Amount left = >>52 - 49 = <<49 = >> 3

To find out how much more money Olivia collected at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket, we subtract the amount spent from the amount collected:

Amount collected at the ATM - Amount spent at the supermarket = <<52 - >>3 = <<49

Therefore, Olivia collected >>49 more at the ATM than she spent at the supermarket.

dave had 15 apps and 24 files on his phone . after deleting some apps and files he had 21 apps and 4 files left . how many more apps than files does he have left on the phone ?,"To solve the math problem, we need to find out how many more apps Dave has left on his phone compared to the number of files. 

First, let's determine the number of apps Dave had initially. We know that he had 15 apps. 

Next, we need to find out how many apps are left on his phone after he deleted some. We know that he has 21 apps left. 

To find out how many more apps he has left, we subtract the initial number of apps from the number of apps left. 

 21 - 15 = << 21 - 15 = 6 >> 6 

So, Dave has 6 more apps than he initially had.

Now, let's find out how many files Dave had initially. We know that he had 24 files.

Next, we need to find out how many files are left on his phone after he deleted some. We know that he has 4 files left.

To find out how many more files he has left, we subtract the initial number of files from the number of files left.

 4 - 24 = << 4 - 24 = -20 >> -20 

So, Dave has 20 fewer files than he initially had.

Finally, to find out how many more apps than files Dave has left, we subtract the number of files he has left from the number of apps he has left.

 6 - (-20) = << 6 - (-20) = 26 >> 26 

So, Dave has 26 more apps than files left on his phone.

According to the information given, the feathers require a total of 288 g of wax. He currently needs 260 g, which means he still needs an additional 28 g of wax.

Since he needs a total of 49 g of colors to paint the feathers, we can set up the following equation:

x + 260 + 28 = 288

Simplifying this equation, we have:

x + 288 = 288

Subtracting 288 from both sides, we get:

x = 0

Therefore, he already has 0 grams of wax.

2. He sold some books in a garage sale, so we subtract the number of books he sold from his initial number of books: <<21 - x>>, where <<x>> represents the number of books he sold.
3. After selling some books, Paul bought 42 new ones, so we add 42 to the number of books he has left: <<(21 - x) + 42>>.
4. We know that Paul currently has 15 books, so we can set up an equation: (21 - x) + 42 = <<(21 - x) + 42 = 15>> 15.
5. Simplifying the equation, we have 63 - x = <<63 - x = 15>> 15.
6. To isolate x>>, we subtract 63 from both sides: <<-x = <<x>>, we subtract 63 from both sides: <<-x = 15 - 63>> 15 - 63.
7. Simplifying further, we get -x = <<-x = -48>> -48.
8. Multiplying both sides by -1 to solve for x>>, we have <<x = <<x>>, we have <<x = 48>> 48.

Therefore, Paul sold 48 more books than he bought.

Number of cakes made = 126
Number of pastries made = 48

Number of cakes sold = 115
Number of pastries sold = 81

To find the difference, we subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of cakes sold:

Difference = Number of cakes sold - Number of pastries sold

Difference = 115 - 81

Calculating the difference:

Difference = 34

Therefore, Baker made 34 more cakes than pastries.

baker made 52 pastries and 84 cakes . if he sold 102 cakes and 94 pastries how many more cakes than pastries did baker make ?,"To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we need to subtract the number of pastries sold from the number of pastries made, and then subtract the number of cakes sold from the number of cakes made.

Number of pastries made: 52
Number of cakes made: 84

Number of pastries sold: 94
Number of cakes sold: 102

To calculate the difference, we subtract the number sold from the number made for each item:

Difference in pastries = Number of pastries made - Number of pastries sold
Difference in cakes = Number of cakes made - Number of cakes sold

Difference in pastries = 52 - 94
Difference in cakes = 84 - 102

Calculating each difference:

Difference in pastries = -42
Difference in cakes = -18

Since both differences are negative, it means that Baker sold more pastries than he made and also sold more cakes than he made. To find out how many more cakes than pastries Baker made, we take the absolute value (ignoring the negative sign) of each difference and compare them:

Absolute value of difference in pastries = |-42| = 42
Absolute value of difference in cakes = |-18| = 18

Therefore, Baker made 18 more cakes than pastries.

paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday . by the end of the school year he had either lost or given away 551 of them and only had 177 left . how many crayons did he get for his birthday ?,"Let's assume that Paul initially had x crayons for his birthday. 

According to the given information, by the end of the school year, he had lost or given away 551 crayons and only had 177 left. 

This can be represented as an equation: 
x - 551 = 177

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding 551 to both sides of the equation:
x - 551 + 551 = 177 + 551
x = 728

Initially, Paul had 51 books and 106 pens.
After selling some books and pens, he had 82 books and 14 pens left.

So, we can set up the following equations based on the given information:

51 - x = 82   (equation for books)
106 - y = 14   (equation for pens)

To find the values of x and y, we can solve these equations simultaneously.

Simplifying the first equation:
51 - x = 82
-x = 82 - 51
-x = 31

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:
x = -31

Simplifying the second equation:
106 - y = 14
-y = 14 - 106
-y = -92

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate y:
y = 92

Therefore, Paul sold 31 books and 92 pens in the garage sale.

zachary did 15 push-ups in gym class today . david did 39 more push-ups than zachary . john did 9 push-ups less than david . how many more push-ups did zachary do than john ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Zachary did 15 push-ups.
2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, so David did 15 + 39 = 54 push-ups.
3. John did 9 push-ups less than David, so John did 54 - 9 = 45 push-ups.

To find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John, we subtract John's number of push-ups from Zachary's:

Zachary - John = 15 - 45

Performing the subtraction:

15 - 45 = -30

Therefore, Zachary did 30 fewer push-ups than John.

Initially, there were 23 children on the bus.
Then, 24 children got on the bus at the bus stop.
After that, some children got off the bus.
Finally, there were 8 children altogether on the bus.

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to calculate the difference between the number of children who got off and those who got on.

Let's represent the number of children who got off as ""x"".

The number of children who got on can be calculated by adding the initial number of children (23) and those who got on at the bus stop (24). So, it is 23 + 24 = 47.

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the situation:

47 - x = 8

To solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 47 from both sides:

47 - x - 47 = 8 - 47

Initially, the waiter had 11 customers. After some left, he still had 3 customers. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

11 - x = 3

To find out how many more customers left than those that stayed behind, we need to solve for ""x"". 

First, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation: 

11 - x - 3 = 3 - 3
8 - x = 0

Next, let's isolate ""x"" by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation: 

8 - x - 8 = 0 - 8
-x = -8

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: 

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-8)
x = 8

Therefore, 8 more customers left than those that stayed behind.

According to the given information, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 24 pounds. Since Marco lost 9 pounds of strawberries on the way back, his strawberries now weigh 3 pounds. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
Marco's strawberries + Marco's dad's strawberries = Total weight of strawberries
3 + x = 24

To find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries, we need to solve for ""x"" in the equation.

Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
x = 24 - 3

Simplifying the right side:
x = 21

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 21 pounds.

Paul started with 531 crayons and 38 erasers. We can represent this as an equation: 531 - 38 = <<531 - 38 = X>> X, where X represents the number of crayons Paul had left at the end.

Simplifying the equation, we have 493 = <<493 = X>> X.

To find out how many more crayons than erasers Paul had left, we subtract the number of erasers (38) from the number of crayons left (X): X - 38 = <<X - 38 = Y>> Y, where Y represents the difference between the number of crayons and erasers.

Substituting X with 493 in the equation, we have 493 - 38 = <<493 - 38 = Y>> Y.

Simplifying the equation, we get 455 = <<455 = Y>> Y.

Therefore, Paul had 455 more crayons than erasers left at the end of the school year.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour . she already put in some cups of flour . if she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar how many cups of flour did she put in ?,"Let's assume the number of cups of flour Mary put in is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the problem, Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, Mary needs 3 + 5 = <<3 + 5 = 8>> 8 cups of flour.

We also know that Mary already put in some cups of flour, which is represented by <<x>>. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = <<x + 5 = 8>> 8

To solve for <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = <<x = 8 - 5>> 8 - 5

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, Mary put in 3 cups of flour.

a waiter had 3 customers . after some left he still had 4 customers . how many more customers stayed behind than those that left ?,"Let's denote the number of customers who left as ""x"". 

Initially, the waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. 

So, the equation representing this situation can be written as:

3 - x = 4

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to solve for ""x"".

Adding ""x"" to both sides of the equation:

3 - x + x = 4 + x

Simplifying:

3 = 4 + x

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation:

3 - 4 = 4 + x - 4

Simplifying:

-1 = x

Therefore, there was 1 more customer who stayed behind than those that left.

36 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop 68 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus . then there were 12 children altogether on the bus . how many more children got off the bus than those that got on ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- Initially, there were 36 children on the bus.
- At the bus stop, 68 children got off the bus.
- After some more children got on the bus, there were 12 children altogether.

To find out how many more children got off the bus than those that got on, we need to determine the difference between the number of children who got off and the number of children who got on.

The number of children who got off is given as 68. To find the number of children who got on, we can subtract the final count (12) from the initial count (36):

36 - 12 = <<36 - 12 = 24>> 24

Therefore, 24 children got on the bus.

Now we can calculate how many more children got off than those that got on by subtracting the number of children who got on from the number of children who got off:

68 - 24 = <<68 - 24 = 44>> 44

So, 44 more children got off the bus than those that got on.

next on his checklist are wax to stick the feathers together . if he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g total how many grams of wax do the feathers require ?,"To find out how many grams of wax the feathers require, we need to subtract the amount of wax he already has (17 g) from the total amount of wax he needs.

Let's denote the amount of wax required by the feathers as ""x"" grams.

We can set up an equation to represent this situation:

x + 17 = 557

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 17 from both sides:

x = 557 - 17

Now, let's calculate the value of x:

x = 540

Therefore, the feathers require 540 grams of wax.

Given:
Number of packages of gum = 21
Number of packages of candy = 45
Number of pieces in each package = 9

To find the total number of pieces of candy:
Total number of pieces of candy = Number of packages of candy * Number of pieces in each package

Substituting the given values:
Total number of pieces of candy = 45 * 9

Calculating:
Total number of pieces of candy = 405

Therefore, Robin has 405 pieces of candy.

edward spent 9 . then he spent 8 more . now he has 17 . how much did edward have before he spent his money ?,"Let's assume that Edward had <<x before he spent his money. 

According to the given information, Edward spent >>9 and then spent 8 more. So, the total amount he spent is >>9 + <<8 = <<8 more. So, the total amount he spent is >>9 + <<8 = >> 17.

Now, we know that after spending his money, Edward has <<17 left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

>>x - 17 = 0<<

To solve for x, we add 17 to both sides of the equation:

>>x = 17<<

So, Edward had >>17 before he spent his money.

baker made 99 cakes . he bought 167 new cakes and sold 89 cakes . how many more cakes did baker buy than those he sold ?,"To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than those he sold, we need to subtract the number of cakes he sold from the number of cakes he bought.

Baker initially had 99 cakes.
He then bought 167 new cakes.
So, the total number of cakes Baker had after buying is 99 + 167 = <<99 + 167 = 266>> 266.

Next, Baker sold 89 cakes.
To find out how many more cakes Baker bought than those he sold, we subtract the number of cakes sold from the total number of cakes after buying.

Therefore, the calculation is 266 - 89 = <<266 - 89 = 177>> 177.

So, Baker bought 177 more cakes than those he sold.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 39 inches . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?,"Let's denote the distance jumped by the frog as <<x>> inches. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, so its distance is <<x + 19>> inches. 

The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance is <<x - 12>> inches. 

We know that the grasshopper jumped a total of 39 inches, so we can set up an equation: 

x + 19 + x - 12 = <<x + 19 + x - 12 = 39>> 39

Simplifying this equation: 

2x + 7 = <<2x + 7 = 39>> 39

Subtracting 7 from both sides: 

2x = <<2x = 32>> 32

Dividing both sides by 2: 

x = <<x = 16>> 16

Therefore, the frog jumped 16 inches and the mouse jumped 16 - 12 = <<16 - 12 = 4>> 4 inches.

Initially, Paul had 42 pens and after selling some, he was left with 19 pens. Therefore, the number of pens he sold can be calculated as:

42 - x = 19

To find the number of books Paul had initially, we subtract the number of books he has left from the total number of books he had initially:

143 - (113) = 30

Since we know that for every pen sold, one book was also sold, we can set up an equation to relate the number of pens and books:

x = 30

Therefore, Paul sold 30 pens in the garage sale.

5 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop 63 children got off the bus while some more got on the bus . then there were 14 children altogether on the bus . how many more children got on the bus than those that got off ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 5 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 63 children got off the bus.
3. After these children got off, there were still some children on the bus.
4. The total number of children on the bus after some got off is given as 14.
5. We need to find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off.

To find the number of additional children who got on the bus, we can subtract the number of children who got off from the total number of children on the bus.

Total number of children on the bus = Number of children who got off + Number of additional children who got on

Let's represent the unknown number of additional children who got on with a variable, say x.

14 = 63 - x

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

14 + x = 63

Subtracting 14 from both sides:

x = 63 - 14

Calculating:

x = 49

Therefore, there were 49 more children who got on the bus than those that got off.

1. Initially, there were 28 children on the bus.
2. At the bus stop, 82 children got on the bus.
3. Let's assume that x children got off the bus.
4. After some children got off, there were 30 children altogether on the bus.
5. So, we can write the equation: 28 + 82 - x = 30.

To find out how many more children got on the bus than those that got off, we need to solve for x.

6. Simplifying the equation: 110 - x = 30.
7. Subtracting 110 from both sides of the equation: -x = -80.
8. Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 to isolate x: x = 80.

Therefore, 80 more children got on the bus than those that got off.

If she used 5 cups of flour on each one , how much cups of flour does she still need ?","Isabel baked 3 brownies, but needed 5 total for her party. If she used 5 cups of flour on each one, we can calculate the total cups of flour she used by multiplying the number of brownies by the cups of flour used per brownie. 

Total cups of flour used = 3 brownies * 5 cups of flour per brownie = 15 cups of flour.

To find out how much cups of flour she still needs, we subtract the total cups of flour used from the total cups of flour needed.

Cups of flour still needed = Total cups of flour needed - Total cups of flour used = 5 total brownies * 5 cups of flour per brownie - 15 cups of flour.

"A pet store has 4 bird cages . If each cage has 8 parrots and 2 parakeets in it , how many birds does the pet store have total ?","To find the total number of birds in the pet store, we need to multiply the number of cages by the number of birds in each cage. 

Given that there are 6 bird cages and each cage has 6 parrots and 2 parakeets, we can calculate the total number of birds as follows:

Number of parrots = 6 cages * 6 parrots per cage = 36 parrots
Number of parakeets = 6 cages * 2 parakeets per cage = 12 parakeets

To find the total number of birds, we add the number of parrots and parakeets together:

Total number of birds = Number of parrots + Number of parakeets = 36 parrots + 12 parakeets = 48 birds

Therefore, the pet store has a total of 48 birds.

Initially, Kelly has 121 Nintendo games.

According to the question, Kelly wants to have 22 games left.
So, we can set up the equation:

Subtracting 121 from both sides:
121 - x - 121 = 22 - 121
-x = -99

Multiplying both sides by -1 (to get rid of the negative sign):
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-99)
x = 99

"The number of gears a machine can make varies directly by how long it operates . If it can make 2088 gears in 8 hours , How many gears can it make in 9 hours ?","To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the concept of direct variation.

Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is directly proportional to the number of hours it operates. We can represent this relationship as:

Number of gears / Number of hours = Constant

Let's call this constant ""k"". So, we have:

Number of gears / Number of hours = k

Now, we are given that the machine can make 2088 gears in 8 hours. We can substitute these values into our equation:

2088 / 8 = k

To find the value of ""k"", we divide 2088 by 8:

k = 261

Now that we have the value of ""k"", we can use it to find how many gears the machine can make in 9 hours. Let's call this unknown value ""x"". We can set up another proportion using our constant ""k"":

Number of gears / Number of hours = k

x / 9 = 261

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

9 * (x / 9) = 261 * 9

This simplifies to:

x = 2349

Therefore, the machine can make 2349 gears in 9 hours.

Mrs. Franklin had 58 Valentines . Mrs. Franklin gave some to her students . Now she has 16 . How many Valentines did Mrs. Franklin give to her students ?,"Let's assume that Mrs. Franklin gave x Valentines to her students.

Initially, Mrs. Franklin had 58 Valentines.
After giving some to her students, she now has 16 Valentines.

We can represent this situation with the equation:
58 - x = 16

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation for x.

Subtracting 16 from both sides of the equation:
58 - x - 16 = 16 - 16
42 - x = 0

To isolate x, we subtract 42 from both sides of the equation:
42 - x - 42 = 0 - 42
-x = -42

Multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 to solve for x:
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-42)
x = 42

Therefore, Mrs. Franklin gave 42 Valentines to her students.

"Luke was putting his spare change into piles . He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes . If each pile had 3 coins in it , how many coins did he have total ?","To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to calculate the number of quarters and dimes separately and then add them together.

Given:
Number of piles of quarters = 5
Number of piles of dimes = 5
Number of coins in each pile = 3

To find the total number of quarters, we can multiply the number of piles of quarters by the number of coins in each pile:
Total number of quarters = 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 quarters

Similarly, to find the total number of dimes, we can multiply the number of piles of dimes by the number of coins in each pile:
Total number of dimes = 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 dimes

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes together:
Total number of coins = Total number of quarters + Total number of dimes = 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins

Therefore, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

Wendy 's old washing machine could only wash 8 pieces of clothing at a time . If she had to wash 39 shirts and 33 sweaters how many loads would she have to do ?,"To find out how many loads Wendy would have to do, we need to divide the total number of clothes she needs to wash by the maximum number of clothes her washing machine can handle in one load.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Find the total number of clothes Wendy needs to wash:
   Total number of shirts = 39
   Total number of sweaters = 33
   Total number of clothes = Total number of shirts + Total number of sweaters

2. Determine the maximum number of clothes her washing machine can handle in one load:
   Maximum number of clothes per load = 8

3. Divide the total number of clothes by the maximum number of clothes per load to find the number of loads:
   Number of loads = Total number of clothes / Maximum number of clothes per load

Now let's perform the calculations:

Total number of shirts = 39
Total number of sweaters = 33
Total number of clothes = 39 + 33 = <<= 72>> 72

Maximum number of clothes per load = 8

Number of loads = 72 / 8 = <<= 9>> 9

You have collected 7 crickets . How many more crickets do you need to collect to have 11 crickets ?,"To find out how many more crickets you need to collect, we can subtract the number of crickets you already have from the desired total.

Let's denote the number of crickets you need to collect as ""x"". 

The equation representing this situation is:

To solve for ""x"", we can isolate it on one side of the equation by subtracting 7 from both sides:
x = <<x = 11 - 7>> 11 - 7

Simplifying the right side gives us:
x = <<x = 4>> 4

Therefore, you need to collect 4 more crickets to have a total of 11 crickets.

Marcus has 210 baseball cards . He has 58 more than Carter . How many baseball cards does Carter have ?,"Let's assume that Carter has x baseball cards.

According to the given information, Marcus has 58 more baseball cards than Carter. So, Marcus would have x + 58 baseball cards.

We also know that Marcus has a total of 210 baseball cards. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x + 58 = 210

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 58 from both sides:

Suzie found 2 worms in the yard and measured them with a ruler . 1 worm was 0.8 inch long . The other worm was 0.1 inch long . How much longer was the longer worm ?,"To find out how much longer the longer worm is, we need to subtract the length of the shorter worm from the length of the longer worm.

Let's denote the length of the longer worm as <<L>> and the length of the shorter worm as <<S>>.

Given that the length of one worm is 0.8 inches (S = <<S = 0.8>> 0.8) and the other worm is 0.1 inches long (L = <<L = 0.1>> 0.1), we can calculate the difference in length by subtracting <<S>> from <<L>>.

L - S = <<L - S = 0.1 - 0.8>> 0.1 - 0.8

To simplify this calculation, we can subtract 0.8 from 0.1:

0.1 - 0.8 = <<0.1 - 0.8 = -0.7>> -0.7

Therefore, the longer worm is 0.7 inches longer than the shorter worm.

"While shopping for music online , Zoe bought 3 country albums and 5 pop albums . Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 3 songs . How many songs did Zoe buy total ?","Zoe bought 3 country albums and 5 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 3 songs. To find the total number of songs Zoe bought, we need to calculate the number of songs in each type of album separately and then add them together.

The number of songs in the country albums can be calculated by multiplying the number of country albums (3) by the number of songs per album (3). So, the number of songs in the country albums is 3 * 3 = <<3 * 3 = 9>> 9.

Similarly, the number of songs in the pop albums can be calculated by multiplying the number of pop albums (5) by the number of songs per album (3). So, the number of songs in the pop albums is 5 * 3 = <<5 * 3 = 15>> 15.

To find the total number of songs Zoe bought, we add the number of songs in the country albums to the number of songs in the pop albums: 9 + 15 = <<9 + 15 = 24>> 24.

x = <<x = 25 - 18>> 25 - 18

Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get: 

x = <<x = 7>> 7

Therefore, 7 children got on the bus at the bus stop.

"Tiffany was playing a video game where she scores 6 points for each treasure she finds . If she found 3 treasures on the first level and 5 on the second , what would her score be ?","To find Tiffany's score, we need to calculate the total number of points she earned from finding treasures on both levels.

On the first level, Tiffany found 3 treasures, and each treasure is worth 6 points. So her score from the first level is 3 * 6 = <<3 * 6 = 18>> 18 points.

On the second level, Tiffany found 5 treasures, and each treasure is also worth 6 points. So her score from the second level is 5 * 6 = <<5 * 6 = 30>> 30 points.

To find her total score, we add up the scores from both levels: 18 + 30 = <<18 + 30 = 48>> 48.

Therefore, Tiffany's score would be 48.

According to the information given, Steve gave Todd 16 more pieces of gum, so we can represent this as ""x + 16"". 

Now, we know that Todd has a total of 54 pieces of gum, so we can set up the equation:

x + 16 = 54

To find the original number of gum pieces Todd had, we need to isolate the variable ""x"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 16 from both sides:

x + 16 - 16 = 54 - 16

Simplifying:

x = 38

Therefore, Todd had 38 pieces of gum to start with.

To isolate x, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

18 - x - 18 = <<18 - x - 18 = 0 - 18>> 0 - 18

Simplifying:

-x = <<-x = -18>> -18

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

-1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-18)>> -1 * (-18)

Simplifying:

x = <<x = 18>> 18

Therefore, Maura gave her little sister 18 seashells.

j.t . has some superhero trading cards . he lost 14 of them . he gave 19 of them to his best friend . now he has 45 cards left . how many cards did j.t . have at first ?,"Let's assume that the number of cards JT had at first is represented by the variable ""x"".

According to the problem, JT lost 14 cards, so we subtract 14 from x: <<x - 14>>.

Then, he gave 19 cards to his best friend, so we subtract another 19 from the previous result: <<(x - 14) - 19>>.

Finally, we know that after losing some and giving some away, JT has 45 cards left. So we set up an equation: (x - 14) - 19 = <<(x - 14) - 19 = 45>> 45.

To find the value of x, we can simplify the equation: x - 33 = <<x - 33 = 45>> 45.

To isolate x, we add 33 to both sides of the equation: x = <<x = 45 + 33>> 45 + 33.

Now we can calculate the final answer: x = <<x = 78>> 78.

He gave 14 books to his best friend, so the number of books remaining in his collection is x - 14.

He also gave 8 books to his little brother, so the number of books remaining further decreases to (x - 14) - 8.

According to the problem, Evan now has 60 books in his collection. So we can set up the equation:

(x - 14) - 8 = 60

Simplifying the equation:

x - 14 - 8 = 60
x - 22 = 60

An ice skating rink charges 5 dollars for admission and 2 dollars to rent skates . Jill can purchase a new pair of skates for 5 dollars . How many times would she need to go the rink to justify buying the skates rather than renting a pair ?,"To determine how many times Jill would need to go to the rink to justify buying skates instead of renting, we need to compare the total cost of renting skates each time versus the cost of purchasing skates.

Let's assume Jill goes to the rink x times. 

The cost of renting skates each time is <<2, so the total cost of renting skates x times would be 2 * x dollars.

On the other hand, if Jill decides to purchase skates, she would only need to pay >>5 once.

To justify buying skates rather than renting, the total cost of renting skates x times should be greater than or equal to the cost of purchasing skates.

So we can set up an inequality: 2 * x >= 5

Now let's solve for x:

Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:
x >= 5/2

Since we can't have a fraction of a visit, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jill would need to go to the rink at least 3 times (since 5/2 rounds up to 3) in order to justify buying skates instead of renting.

a box can hold 18 pieces of chalk . if there are 3484 pieces of chalk how many boxes are full to hold all the chalk ?,"To find the number of boxes that are full to hold all the chalk, we need to divide the total number of pieces of chalk by the capacity of each box.

Given:
Capacity of each box = 18 pieces
Total number of pieces of chalk = 3484

To calculate the number of boxes:
Number of boxes = Total number of pieces of chalk / Capacity of each box

Substituting the given values:
Number of boxes = 3484 / 18

Performing the division:
Number of boxes ≈ 193.5556

Since we cannot have a fraction of a box, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are approximately 194 boxes that are full to hold all the chalk.

"My dog had some bones . Then , he dug up 367 bones . Now he has 860 bones . How many bones did he start with ?","Let's assume the number of bones my dog started with is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, my dog dug up 367 bones, so we can subtract this from the total number of bones he currently has: <<x - 367>>.

We also know that my dog now has 860 bones, so we can set up the equation: x - 367 = <<x - 367 = 860>> 860.

To find the value of x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 367 to both sides: <<x - 367 + 367 = <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 367 to both sides: <<x - 367 + 367 = 860 + 367>> 860 + 367.

Simplifying the equation gives us: x = <<x = 1227>> 1227.

Therefore, my dog started with 1227 bones.

Let's start by calculating the fraction of nails that are size 2d. We are given that 0.25 (or 25%) of the nails are size 2d. To represent this as a fraction, we can write it as 2/5>>. Next, let's calculate the fraction of nails that are size 4d. We are given that 0.5 (or 50%) of the nails are size 4d. As a fraction, this can be written as <<5/10>>. Now, we can add these two fractions together to find the total fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d: <<2/5 + 5/10 = <<2/5>>. Next, let's calculate the fraction of nails that are size 4d. We are given that 0.5 (or 50%) of the nails are size 4d. As a fraction, this can be written as <<5/10>>. Now, we can add these two fractions together to find the total fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d: <<2/5 + 5/10 = 7/10>> 7/10. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1: 7/10 = <<7/10 = 7/10>> 7/10. Therefore, seven-tenths (or <<7/10>>) of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.

1. Benny received <<79.
2. Benny also received 9 movie tickets.
3. He went to a sporting goods store and bought a baseball glove, baseball, and bat.
4. After the purchases, he had >>32 left.

To find out how much Benny spent on the baseball gear, we can start by determining how much money he had before going to the sporting goods store. Then, we can subtract the remaining amount to find the total amount spent on the baseball gear.

Step 1: Benny received <<79.
Step 2: Benny received 9 movie tickets, which do not affect the money spent on the baseball gear, so we can ignore them for this calculation.

Step 3: Let's assume Benny spent >>X on the baseball gear.

Step 4: After the purchases, he had <<32 left, so we can represent this as:
>>79 (initial amount) - X (spent on baseball gear) = <<X (spent on baseball gear) = >> 32 (remaining amount)

Now, we need to solve for X:

<<79 - >>X = <<32

To isolate X, we can subtract >>32 from both sides:

X = <<X = >> 79 - <<32

Now, we can calculate the value of X:

>>X = <<47

So, Benny spent >>47 on the baseball gear.

Luke had 20 stickers . He bought 12 stickers from a store in the mall and got 20 stickers for his birthday . Then Luke gave 5 of the stickers to his sister and used 8 to decorate a greeting card . How many stickers does Luke have left ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Luke starts with 20 stickers.
2. He buys 12 stickers from the store, so he now has 20 + 12 stickers.
3. He also receives 20 stickers for his birthday, so he now has 20 + 12 + 20 stickers.
4. Luke gives 5 stickers to his sister, which means he has 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 stickers left.
5. He uses 8 stickers to decorate a greeting card, which leaves him with 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 - 8 stickers.

Now, let's calculate the final number of stickers Luke has left:

<< 20 + 12 + 20 - 5 - 8 >>

First, add the numbers in the parentheses:

 20 + 12 + 20 = << 20 + 12 + 20 = 52 >> 52 

Now, subtract 5:

 52 - 5 = << 52 - 5 = 47 >> 47

Total amount spent = <<900
Amount given to the first set of homeless families = >>325
Amount given to the second set of homeless families = <<260

To find the amount given to the last set of homeless families, we subtract the amounts given to the first and second sets from the total amount spent:

Amount given to the last set of homeless families = Total amount spent - Amount given to the first set - Amount given to the second set
Amount given to the last set of homeless families = >>900 - <<325 - >>260

Now we can perform the subtraction:

Amount given to the last set of homeless families = <<315

Therefore, she gave >>315 to the last set of homeless families.

To solve for X, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation:

35 - X - 33 = <<35 - X - 33 = 33 - 33>> 33 - 33

Simplifying this:

2 - X = <<2 - X = 0>> 0

Now, to isolate X, we can add X to both sides of the equation:

2 - X + X = <<2 - X + X = 0 + X>> 0 + X

Simplifying:

2 = <<2 = X>> X

So, Adam ate 2 strawberries.

27>> trays from the first table + <<5>> trays from the second table = <<27>> trays from the first table + <<5>> trays from the second table = <<27 + 5>> <<27 + 5

Now, we'll divide this total by the number of trays Ned can carry in one trip (8 trays per trip):
<<(27 + 5) / 8>>

Let's calculate this division:
(27 + 5) / 8 = <<(27 + 5) / 8 = 32 / 8 = 4>> 32 / 8 = 4

So, Ned will make 4 trips to pick up all the trays.

Let's call the number of pieces Isabel had to start with ""X.""

According to the information given, she gave her friend 27 pieces and had 61 left. We can express this as an equation:

X - 27 = <<X - 27 = 61>> 61

Now, we want to isolate X on one side of the equation. To do that, we need to get rid of the -27 on the left side. We can achieve this by adding 27 to both sides of the equation:

X - 27 + 27 = <<X - 27 + 27 = 61 + 27>> 61 + 27

This simplifies to:

X = <<X = 88>> 88

So, Isabel had 88 pieces of candy to start with.

there were 58 people on the train . at the next stop 45 people got off . how many people are there on the train now ?,"To find the number of people on the train after 45 people got off, we need to subtract 45 from the initial number of people on the train.

Initial number of people on the train = 58
Number of people who got off at the next stop = 45

Therefore, the number of people on the train now can be found by subtracting 45 from 58:

58 - 45 = <<58 - 45 = 13>> 13

There are 13 people on the train now.
