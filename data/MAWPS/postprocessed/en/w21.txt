"rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework . if she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework how many pages did she have to complete in all ?" ; "Let's assume that Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete is x + 3.

In total, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + (x + 3) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.

To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we add the number of pages of math and reading homework:

2 + (2 + 3) = 2 + 5 = 7

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages in total. Answer: ####

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 25 inches . the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?" ; "Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
- The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the frog and then subtract 26 inches from it.

The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can calculate its distance as 25 + 32 = <<25 + 32 = 57>> 57 inches.

Now, we need to subtract 26 inches from the frog's distance to find out how far the mouse jumped. 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 57 - 26 = <<57 - 26 = 31>> 31 inches.

"there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase . how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now ?" ; "Let's denote the number of additional roses Jessica cut from her flower garden as <<x>>, and the number of additional orchids as <<y>>.

Initially, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 7 + x = <<7 + x = 11>> 11
This equation represents the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Equation 2: 12 + y = <<12 + y = 20>> 20
This equation represents the total number of orchids in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Solving Equation 1 for <<x>>:
7 + x = <<7 + x = 11>> 11
Subtracting 7 from both sides:
x = <<x = 4>> 4

Solving Equation 2 for <<y>>:
12 + y = <<12 + y = 20>> 20
Subtracting 12 from both sides:
y = <<y = 8>> 8

Therefore, Jessica cut 4 more roses and 8 more orchids from her flower garden.

We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write <<M = <<M>> and the weight of his dad's strawberries as <<D>>. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write <<M = 30>> 30. We are also given that together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds, so we can write M + D = <<M + D = 17>> 17. 

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights, which is <<M - D>>. 

We can substitute the value of <<M>> from the first equation into the second equation to solve for <<D>>. 

M + D = <<M + D = 17>> 17

30 + D = <<30 + D = 17>> 17

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

D = <<D = 17 - 30>> 17 - 30

Simplifying the right side:

D = <<D = -13>> -13

Now we can substitute the value of <<D>> into the expression <<M - D>> to find the difference in weights:

M - D = <<M - D = 30 - (-13)>> 30 - (-13)

Simplifying the expression:

M - D = <<M - D = 30 + 13>> 30 + 13

M - D = <<M - D = 43>> 43

Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 43 pounds more than his dad's.

 tDavid's crunches = << tDavid's crunches = tZachary's crunches - 62 >> tZachary's crunches - 62 

Substituting the given values:

 tDavid's crunches = << tDavid's crunches = 58 - 62 >> 58 - 62 

Simplifying the calculation:

 tDavid's crunches = << tDavid's crunches = -4 >> -4 

Since negative numbers don't make sense in this context, we can conclude that David didn't do any crunches.

Now let's find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. We can calculate it as:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = tZachary's crunches - tZachary's push-ups >> tZachary's crunches - tZachary's push-ups 

Substituting the given values:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = 58 - 46 >> 58 - 46 

Simplifying the calculation:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = 12 >> 12 

Therefore, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups.

Substituting the value of Zachary's push-ups (44) into the equation:

 tDavid's push-ups = << tDavid's push-ups = 44 + 58 >> 44 + 58 

Simplifying the equation:

 tDavid's push-ups = << tDavid's push-ups = 102 >> 102 

Now, to find out how many push-ups Zachary and David did altogether, we can add their individual numbers of push-ups:

 tTotal push-ups = << tTotal push-ups = tZachary's push-ups + tDavid's push-ups >> tZachary's push-ups + tDavid's push-ups 

Substituting the values we found:

 tTotal push-ups = << tTotal push-ups = 44 + 102 >> 44 + 102 

Calculating the sum:

 tTotal push-ups = << tTotal push-ups = 146 >> 146

"nell collects baseball cards . she had 566 cards while jeff had 234 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 535 cards left . how many cards does jeff have now ?" ; "Let's denote the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff as ""x"". 

Initially, Nell had 566 cards and Jeff had 234 cards. After Nell gave some cards to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
566 - x = 535

To find the value of ""x"", we can subtract 535 from both sides of the equation: 
566 - x - 535 = 535 - 535
31 - x = 0

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation: 
31 - x - 31 = 0 - 31
-x = -31

To isolate ""x"", we multiply both sides of the equation by -1 (to change the sign): 
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-31)
x = 31

Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 31 cards. 

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we can add the number of cards he initially had (234) to the number of cards Nell gave him (31): 
234 + 31 = ####

Jeff now has #### cards.

"the ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day . in total in 30 days they earned 420 dollars . together with game they earned 22 dollars . how much did ring toss game make per day ?" ; "Let's assume that the amount of money made by the ring toss game each day is represented by the variable <<x>>.

According to the problem, the ring toss game made the same amount of money each day. So, we can set up an equation:

30x = <<30x = 420>> 420

This equation represents that the total amount earned in 30 days (<<30x>>) is equal to <<420.

Now, we are given that together with the other games, they earned >>22. Since we know that the ring toss game made <<x>> dollars per day, we can subtract <<x>> from <<22>> to find out how much the other games made:

<<22 - x>>

The total earnings from all games should be equal to <<420>>, so we can set up another equation:

x + (22 - x) = <<x + (22 - x) = 420>> 420

Simplifying this equation, we get:

22 = <<22 = 420>> 420

This equation is not possible since it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there seems to be an error or inconsistency in the information provided in the question.

"lucy went to the grocery store . she bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake . in the end she had 56 amount of change remaining . how many packs of groceries did she buy in all ?" ; "Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake.
2. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in total.
3. To do that, we can add the number of packs of cookies and the number of packs of cake together.
4. So, we have 2 + 12 = <<2 + 12 = 14>> 14 packs of groceries.
5. However, we also know that Lucy had 56 units of change remaining.
6. This means that the total cost of all the groceries she bought was equal to the amount she initially had plus the change she received back.
7. Let's assume the initial amount Lucy had was X units.
8. Therefore, we can write an equation: X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining) = total cost of groceries.
9. Since we don't know the value of X, we cannot directly calculate the total cost of groceries.
10. However, we can still determine the number of packs of groceries Lucy bought by using the information from step 4.
11. We know that each pack of groceries costs the same amount, so if we divide the total cost by the cost per pack, we will get the number of packs.
12. Let's assume each pack costs Y units.
13. Now we can write another equation: Y (cost per pack) * 14 (total number of packs) = X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining).
14. Simplifying this equation gives us: 14Y = X + 56.
15. Since we don't know the values of X or Y, we cannot directly solve this equation for either variable.
16. However, we can make an assumption about Y to find a solution.
17. Let's assume each pack costs Z units, where Z is a positive integer greater than zero.
18. Now we can rewrite the equation as: 14Z = X + 56.
19. By substituting Z with different positive integers, we can find a solution where X is also a positive integer greater than zero.
20. Let's try Z = 4.
21. Substituting Z = 4 into the equation gives us: 14 * 4 = X + 56.
22. Simplifying this equation gives us: 56 = X + 56.
23. Subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation gives us: X = 0

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Frank read. Since each book had 249 pages and he finished multiple books, we can multiply the number of pages per book by the number of books he finished. Let's assume he finished ""n"" books.

Total number of pages = 249 * n

Next, we need to determine how many days it took Frank to finish the books. According to the information given, it took him 3 days to finish each book. Since he finished ""n"" books, we can multiply the number of days per book by the number of books he finished.

Total number of days = 3 * n

Finally, to find out how many pages Frank read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the total number of days.

Pages read per day = (249 * n) / (3 * n)

Simplifying this expression, we can cancel out the ""n"" terms:

Pages read per day = 249 / 3

"dan has $ 3 . for a total of $ 4 he bought 2 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money . how much did each candy bar cost ?" ; "To find out how much each candy bar cost, we can set up an equation. Let's assume the cost of each candy bar is <<x.

Since Dan bought 2 candy bars, the total cost would be 2 times the cost of one candy bar, which is 2x.

According to the problem, Dan has a total of >>4. So we can set up the equation:

2x = 4

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

(2x)/2 = 4/2

Simplifying:

x = 2

Therefore, each candy bar costs $2.

"there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase . how many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now ?" ; "Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her flower garden as <<x>>, and the number of orchids she cut as <<y>>. 

Initially, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. 

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) The number of roses: 5 + x = <<5 + x = 12>> 12
2) The number of orchids: 3 + y = <<3 + y = 2>> 2

To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses.

Substituting the values from equation (1) into equation (2), we have:

3 + y = <<3 + y = 2>> 2
y = <<y = 2 - 3>> 2 - 3
y = <<y = -1>> -1

Since it is not possible to have a negative number of orchids, we can conclude that Jessica did not cut any orchids from her flower garden.

Now, substituting the value of <<y>> into equation (1), we have:

5 + x = <<5 + x = 12>> 12
x = <<x = 12 - 5>> 12 - 5
x = <<x = 7>> 7

We are given that there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase.

Next, we are told that Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Let's assume she cut r roses and o orchids.

After cutting these flowers, the total number of roses in the vase becomes 9 + r, and the total number of orchids becomes 6 + o.

Finally, we are given that there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So we can set up the following equations:

9 + r = 3   (equation 1)
6 + o = 13  (equation 2)

To find how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids. Let's solve for r in equation 1 and substitute it into equation 2:

r = 3 - 9
r = -6

Substituting this value of r into equation 2:

6 + o = 13
o = 13 - 6
o = 7

We can represent this situation mathematically as: 
>>4 - x = <<3

To find the value of x (the cost of the candy bar), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting >>3 from both sides of the equation, we get: 
<<4 - >>3 = x

Simplifying, we have: 
<<1 = x

Therefore, the candy bar cost >>1.

"paul had 108 books . after selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?" ; "Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 books left.

According to the problem, he had 62 books left after all these transactions. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:

108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

2. He gave 39 books to his friend, so he now has 134 - 39 = 95 books.
3. After selling some books in a garage sale, he had 68 books left.
4. Let's assume he sold x books in the garage sale.
5. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is: 95 - x = 68.
6. To find the value of x, we can subtract 68 from both sides of the equation: 95 - x - 68 = 0.
7. Simplifying the equation gives us: 27 - x = 0.
8. To isolate x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: 27 - x + x = x.

"steven has 19 peaches . jake has 12 fewer peaches than steven and 72 more peaches than jill . how many peaches does jake have ?" ; "Let's break down the information given:

1. Steven has 19 peaches.
2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first.

Since Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, we can express this as an equation: Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches.

Now, let's substitute the information we have:

Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches

We don't know Jill's number of peaches yet, so let's represent it with a variable, say ""x"":

x + 72 = Jake's peaches

Next, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 19 peaches, we can express this as an equation: Steven's peaches - 12 = Jake's peaches.

Substituting the known values:

19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

Now we have two equations for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = Jake's peaches
19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

To solve for x and find Jill's number of peaches, we can equate the two expressions for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = 19 - 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 72 = 7

Subtracting 72 from both sides:

x = -65

Now that we know Jill has -65 peaches (which doesn't make sense in this context), it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the given information. Please double-check the problem statement or provide any additional details if available.

So, Jake has 136 apples.

Next, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches. To find the number of peaches Jake has, we can subtract 10 from the number of peaches Steven has.

 13 - 10 = << 13 - 10 = 3 >> 3

Bobby ate 33 pieces of candy.
Bobby ate 4 more pieces of candy.
So, Bobby ate 33 + 4 = 37 pieces of candy.

Bobby also ate 14 pieces of chocolate.

To find the total number of pieces of candy and chocolate Bobby ate altogether, we add the number of pieces of candy to the number of pieces of chocolate:
37 + 14 = 51

Bobby initially ate 34 pieces of candy.

"bobby had 22 pieces of candy . he ate some pieces of candy . then he ate 5 more . if he still has 8 pieces of candy left how many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start ?" ; "Let's assume that Bobby had eaten x pieces of candy at the start.

After eating some pieces of candy, he had 22 - x pieces of candy left.

Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 = 17 - x pieces of candy left.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

-x = -9

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)

x = 9

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate x pieces, then the number of pieces he has left can be represented as 32 - x. 

According to the problem, Bobby has 20 pieces of candy left. So we can set up the equation: 

32 - x = 20

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 32 from both sides:

32 - x - 32 = 20 - 32
-x = -12

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-12)
x = 12

Therefore, Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy.

According to the problem, there are 182 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. So we can write:

m = <<m = 182>> 182

It is also mentioned that there were other students who suggested adding bacon to the menu. The problem states that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. 

So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon can be represented as ""m + 166"".

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested bacon and mashed potatoes combined is:

<<m + (m + 166)>>

Simplifying this expression, we get:

<<2m + 166>>

Since we know that a total of 182 students suggested mashed potatoes, we can set up an equation:

2m + 166 = <<2m + 166 = 182>> 182

To solve for ""m"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us:

2m = <<2m = 182 - 166>> 182 - 166

Simplifying further:

2m = <<2m = 16>> 16

Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of ""m"":

m = <<m = 1 / 62>> 1 / 62

m = <<m = 8>> 8

Therefore, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.

To find out how many students suggested bacon, we substitute the value of ""m"" into our expression for the number of students who suggested bacon:

m + 166 = <<m + 166 = 8 + 166>> 8 + 166

Calculating this expression gives us:

3. We also know that there are 142 more boys than girls.

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together.

Let's calculate the number of boys:
- If there are 142 more boys than girls, we can represent this as <<700 + 142>>.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pupils:
- To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of girls and boys: <<700 + (700 + 142)>>.

Simplifying this expression:
- 700 + (700 + 142) = <<700 + (700 + 142) = 700 + 700 + 142>> 700 + 700 + 142.

Adding these numbers together:
- $700 + 700 + 142 = ####.

Therefore, there are #### pupils in that school.

"in a school there are 706 girls and 222 boys . 418 more girls joined the school . how many pupils are there in the school now ?" ; "#### 1346"

"in a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys . 465 more girls joined the school . how many more girls than boys does the school have ?" ; "To find out how many more girls than boys the school has, we need to calculate the difference between the number of girls and the number of boys.

First, let's determine the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. We can do this by adding the initial number of girls to the additional girls who joined:

632 + 465 = <<632 + 465 = 1097>> 1097

So, there are now 1097 girls in the school.

Next, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls to find out how many more girls than boys there are:

1097 - 410 = <<1097 - 410 = 687>> 687

Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.

"edward spent 4 to buy books and 3 to buy pens . now he has 12 . how much did edward spend on books and pens ?" ; "Let's assume the amount Edward spent on books is represented by <<x>> and the amount he spent on pens is represented by <<y>>. 

According to the given information, Edward spent <<4>> to buy books and <<3>> to buy pens. So we can write two equations based on this:

Equation 1: x + y = <<x + y = 12>> 12 (Edward has a total of <<12>> after buying books and pens)
Equation 2: x = <<x = 4 + y>> 4 + y (Edward spent <<4>> on books)

To find the values of <<x>> and <<y>>, we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

(4 + y) + y = <<(4 + y) + y = 12>> 12

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4 + 2y = <<4 + 2y = 12>> 12

Subtracting <<4>> from both sides:

2y = <<2y = 8>> 8

Dividing both sides by <<2>>, we find:

y = <<y = 4>> 4

Now that we know the value of <<y>>, we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find the value of <<x>>:

x = <<x = 4 + 4>> 4 + 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = <<x = 8>> 8

Therefore, Edward spent <<8>> on books and <<4>> on pens.

To find the difference between the number of reading and biology homework pages, we can subtract the number of biology homework pages from the number of reading homework pages:

1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to subtract 2 inches from the grasshopper's jump:

3. Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 2 inches.

Substituting the value of the grasshopper's jump (13 inches) into the equation:

4. Frog's jump = 13 inches - 2 inches.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

5. Frog's jump = 11 inches.

Therefore, the frog jumped 11 inches.

#### 11"
"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?" ; "Let's assume that the distance the frog jumped is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Therefore, the grasshopper's jump can be represented as <<x + 4>>.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump can be represented as <<x - 44>>.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up an equation:

(x + 4) + (x - 44) = <<(x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19>> 19

Simplifying this equation:

x + x + 4 - 44 = <<x + x + 4 - 44 = 19>> 19

Combining like terms:

2x - 40 = <<2x - 40 = 19>> 19

Adding 40 to both sides of the equation:

2x = <<2x = 59>> 59

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = <<x = 5 / 92>> 5 / 92

Therefore, the frog jumped <<5 / 92>> inches.

"the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 21 inches . the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse ?" ; "Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Let's represent the distance jumped by the frog as ""x"" inches. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x + 25"" inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x - 16"" inches.

Now, we can calculate how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse by subtracting their distances:

Distance jumped by grasshopper - Distance jumped by mouse
= (x + 25) - (x - 16)

Simplifying this expression:

= x + 25 - x + 16
= x - x + 25 + 16
= 41

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.

The cost of the chocolate is given as 7 and the cost of the candy bar is given as 2. 

So, to find out how much more Dan spent on chocolate than on the candy bar, we can subtract 2 from 7:

"paul had 108 books . after selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?" ; "Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 books left.

According to the problem, he had 62 books left after giving away and selling some books. So we can set up the equation:

(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:

108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

"paul sold some books in a garage sale leaving him with 27 books . if he had 136 books initially how many books did he sell ?" ; "Let's denote the number of books Paul sold as ""x"". 

We know that Paul initially had 136 books and he sold some of them, leaving him with 27 books. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

136 - x = 27

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 27 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

136 - 27 = x

Simplifying the left side gives us: 

109 = x

Therefore, Paul sold 109 books.

1. We know that Steven has 14 peaches.
2. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can subtract 6 from the number of peaches Steven has: 14 - 6 = <<14 - 6 = 8>> 8.
3. Jake also has 3 more peaches than Jill, so we can add 3 to the number of peaches Jill has: 8 + 3 = <<8 + 3 = 11>> 11.

Therefore, Jill has 11 peaches.

"jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than steven . steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches . how many more apples than peaches does steven have ?" ; "To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we need to compare the number of apples and peaches he has.

Given information:
Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches.

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 3 from the number of peaches Steven has.
Peaches Jake has = 15 - 3 = 12

Similarly, Jake has 4 more apples than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of apples Jake has by adding 4 to the number of apples Steven has.
Apples Jake has = 19 + 4 = 23

Now, let's compare the number of apples and peaches Steven has:
Apples - Peaches = 19 - 15 = 4

Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.

"dave had 21 apps on his phone . he added 89 new apps . after deleting some he had 24 left . how many more apps did he add than he deleted ?" ; "Let's assume that Dave deleted ""x"" number of apps.

Initially, Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He then added 89 new apps, resulting in a total of 21 + 89 = 110 apps.

After deleting some apps, he had 24 left. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

110 - x = 24

To find the value of ""x,"" we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

110 - x - 24 = 24 - 24
86 - x = 0

To isolate ""x,"" we subtract 86 from both sides:

86 - x - 86 = 0 - 86
-x = -86

Finally, to solve for ""x,"" we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-86)
x = 86

Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we subtract the number of deleted apps from the number of added apps:

89 - 86 = ####

Dave started with 15 apps on his phone and added 71 new apps, so the total number of apps he had before deleting any would be 15 + 71 = <<15 + 71 = 86>> 86.

After deleting some apps, Dave had 14 left. 

To find out how many more apps Dave deleted than he added, we subtract the number of apps he added from the number of apps he had left: 86 - 14 = <<86 - 14 = 72>> 72.

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 more apps than he added.

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 10 cards. She then gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 10 cards and 178 baseball cards left.

"after a typhoon 13 trees in haley 's backyard died . if she had grown 3 trees initially how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived ?" ; "To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died in the typhoon and the number of trees that survived.

Given:
- Initially, Haley had grown 3 trees.
- After the typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon.

Total number of trees before the typhoon = Initial trees + Trees that died
Total number of trees before the typhoon = 3 + 13

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees before the typhoon:

3 + 13 = <<3 + 13 = 16>> 16

So, there were a total of 16 trees before the typhoon.

To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon:

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees before the typhoon - Trees that died
Number of trees that survived = 16 - 13

Now, let's calculate the number of trees that survived:

16 - 13 = <<16 - 13 = 3>> 3

So, there were 3 trees that survived.

To find how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died:

Number of trees that died more than those that survived = Trees that died - Number of trees that survived
Number of trees that died more than those that survived = 13 - 3

Now, let's calculate how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived:

13 - 3 = <<13 - 3 = 10>> 10

Therefore, there were 10 more trees that died in the typhoon than those that survived.

The total number of trees initially is given as 11.

The number of trees that died is given as 2.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees initially:

11 - 2 = <<11 - 2 = 9>> 9

Therefore, 9 more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.

"he then went to see the oranges being harvested . he found out that they harvest 8 sacks per day . how many days will it take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges ?" ; "To find out how many days it will take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's assume that the number of days required to harvest 24 sacks is represented by ""x"". 

We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day, so the proportion can be set up as:

8 / 1 = <<8 / 1 = 2 / 4x>> 2 / 4x

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply:

8x = <<8x = 24>> 24

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

x = <<x = 2 / 48>> 2 / 48

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.

"jesse has 18 square feet of carpet . if her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor ?" ; "To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor, we first need to calculate the area of her room. The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given that the length of Jesse's room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, we can calculate the area as follows:

 tArea = << tArea = tlength * twidth = 4 * 20 = 80 >> tlength * twidth = 4 * 20 = 80  square feet.

Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, we can subtract this from the total area of the room to determine how much more carpet she needs:

 tMore carpet needed = << tMore carpet needed = tTotal area - tCarpet already owned = 80 - 18 = 62 >> tTotal area - tCarpet already owned = 80 - 18 = 62  square feet.

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 62 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

According to the information given, Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started jogging, she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week.

To find out how much she weighed before starting to jog, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her current weight.

Total weight lost = weight lost in the first week + weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 62 kilograms + 140 kilograms

Now, we can calculate Jessie's weight before starting to jog by adding the total weight lost to her current weight:

Jessie's weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Total weight lost
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + (62 kilograms + 140 kilograms)

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + 202 kilograms
