rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework . if she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework how many pages did she have to complete in all ?,"Let's assume that Rachel had to complete x pages of reading homework. According to the given information, she had to complete 3 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

So, the number of pages of math homework Rachel had to complete is x + 3.

In total, Rachel had to complete 8 pages of math homework. Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + (x + 3) = 8

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 3 = 8

Subtracting 3 from both sides:

2x = 5

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2.5

Since we cannot have a fraction of a page, we can conclude that Rachel had to complete 2 pages of reading homework.

To find the total number of pages Rachel had to complete, we add the number of pages of math and reading homework:

2 + (2 + 3) = 2 + 5 = 7

Therefore, Rachel had to complete 7 pages in total. Answer: ####

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 25 inches . the frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

- The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
- The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the frog and then subtract 26 inches from it.

The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can calculate its distance as 25 + 32 = <<25 + 32 = 57>> 57 inches.

Now, we need to subtract 26 inches from the frog's distance to find out how far the mouse jumped. 

Therefore, the mouse jumped 57 - 26 = <<57 - 26 = 31>> 31 inches.

there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase . how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now ?,"Let's denote the number of additional roses Jessica cut from her flower garden as <<x>>, and the number of additional orchids as <<y>>.

Initially, there were 7 roses and 12 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 11 roses and 20 orchids in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 7 + x = <<7 + x = 11>> 11
This equation represents the total number of roses in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Equation 2: 12 + y = <<12 + y = 20>> 20
This equation represents the total number of orchids in the vase after Jessica cut some more.

Solving Equation 1 for <<x>>:
7 + x = <<7 + x = 11>> 11
Subtracting 7 from both sides:
x = <<x = 4>> 4

Solving Equation 2 for <<y>>:
12 + y = <<12 + y = 20>> 20
Subtracting 12 from both sides:
y = <<y = 8>> 8

Therefore, Jessica cut 4 more roses and 8 more orchids from her flower garden.

To find out how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now, we subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids:

20 - 11 = <<20 - 11 = ####>> ####

after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that 92 visitors came to the buckingham palace that day . if there were 419 visitors the previous day and 103 visitors the day before that how many visited the buckingham palace before that day ?,"To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace before the day mentioned, we need to add up the number of visitors from each day.

Given:
- 92 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the current day.
- 419 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace the previous day.
- 103 visitors came to the Buckingham Palace two days before.

To calculate the total number of visitors before the current day, we can add up the number of visitors from each day:

Total visitors = Number of visitors on the current day + Number of visitors on the previous day + Number of visitors two days before

Total visitors = 92 + 419 + 103

Calculating this sum:

Total visitors = 614

Therefore, there were a total of 614 visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace before the current day.

Given that there were 661 visitors on that day and 600 visitors the previous day, we can find the difference by subtracting the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day.

Let's calculate it step by step:

Number of visitors on that day: 661
Number of visitors the previous day: 600

To find the additional visitors, we subtract the number of visitors on the previous day from the number of visitors on that day:

Additional visitors = Number of visitors on that day - Number of visitors the previous day
Additional visitors = 661 - 600

Now, let's calculate the difference:

Additional visitors = 61

Therefore, there were 61 more visitors who visited the Buckingham Palace on that day compared to the previous day.

the school is planning a field trip . the school has 87 classrooms . there are 58 students in the school with each classroom having the same number of students . if there are 2 seats on each school bus . how many buses are needed to take the trip ?,"To find out how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to determine the total number of students and then divide it by the number of seats on each bus.

Given:
- Number of classrooms: 87
- Number of students in the school: 58

To find the total number of students, we can multiply the number of classrooms by the number of students in each classroom:

 tTotal number of students = << tTotal number of students = tNumber of classrooms * tNumber of students per classroom >> tNumber of classrooms * tNumber of students per classroom 

 tTotal number of students = << tTotal number of students = 87 * 58 >> 87 * 58 

Calculating this:

 tTotal number of students = << tTotal number of students = 5046 >> 5046 

Now, to determine the number of buses needed, we divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus (which is 2):

 tNumber of buses needed = << tNumber of buses needed = \ / textTotal number of students}t{Number of seats per bus} >> \ / textTotal number of students}t{Number of seats per bus} 

 tNumber of buses needed = << tNumber of buses needed = 5 / 046}2 >> 5 / 046}2 

Calculating this:

 tNumber of buses needed = << tNumber of buses needed = 2523 >> 2523

marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 30 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds . how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad 's ?,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's strawberries as M>> and the weight of his dad's strawberries as <<D>>. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write <<M = <<M>> and the weight of his dad's strawberries as <<D>>. We are given that Marco's strawberries weighed 30 pounds, so we can write <<M = 30>> 30. We are also given that together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds, so we can write M + D = <<M + D = 17>> 17. 

To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we need to calculate the difference between their weights, which is <<M - D>>. 

We can substitute the value of <<M>> from the first equation into the second equation to solve for <<D>>. 

M + D = <<M + D = 17>> 17

30 + D = <<30 + D = 17>> 17

Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation:

D = <<D = 17 - 30>> 17 - 30

Simplifying the right side:

D = <<D = -13>> -13

Now we can substitute the value of <<D>> into the expression <<M - D>> to find the difference in weights:

M - D = <<M - D = 30 - (-13)>> 30 - (-13)

Simplifying the expression:

M - D = <<M - D = 30 + 13>> 30 + 13

M - D = <<M - D = 43>> 43

Therefore, Marco's strawberries weighed 43 pounds more than his dad's.

brenda 's mother made cookies for 5 . she prepared 22 cookies but had to throw away 17 cookies . if each of them had the same number of cookies how many did each of them have ?,"Let's assume that Brenda and her mother each had x number of cookies.

According to the given information, Brenda's mother made cookies for 5, so she prepared 5x cookies.
But she had to throw away 17 cookies, so the total number of cookies remaining is 5x - 17.

Since both Brenda and her mother had the same number of cookies, we can set up the equation:
Brenda's cookies + Mother's cookies = Total remaining cookies
x + (5x - 17) = 22

Simplifying the equation:
6x - 17 = 22
Adding 17 to both sides:
6x = 39
Dividing both sides by 6:
x = 6.5

So, each of them had 6.5 cookies.

they decided to hold the party in their backyard . if they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs how many more chairs than tables do they have ?,"To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we need to determine the total number of chairs and tables separately.

Given that they have 5 sets of tables and each set has 10 chairs, we can calculate the total number of chairs by multiplying the number of sets by the number of chairs per set.

Total number of chairs = 5 sets * 10 chairs/set = 50 chairs

Since they have 5 sets of tables, the total number of tables is simply 5.

To find out how many more chairs than tables they have, we subtract the number of tables from the number of chairs.

Number of chairs - Number of tables = 50 chairs - 5 tables = 45

Therefore, they have 45 more chairs than tables.

there were 15 roses in the vase . jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase . there are now 17 roses in the vase . how many more roses did she cut than those she threw away ?,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her flower garden as ""x"". 

Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase. Jessica then threw away 33 roses, so the number of roses remaining in the vase is given by: 

15 - 33 = <<15 - 33 = -18>> -18

However, we know that there are now 17 roses in the vase. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

-18 + x = <<-18 + x = 17>> 17

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation for ""x"". 

Adding 18 to both sides of the equation gives us: 

x = <<x = 17 + 18>> 17 + 18

Simplifying the right side gives us: 

x = <<x = 35>> 35

Therefore, Jessica cut 35 more roses than she threw away.

after a typhoon 13 trees in haley 's backyard died . if she had grown 3 trees initially how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived ?,"If Haley had initially grown 3 trees and 13 trees died in the typhoon, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived.

To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees initially grown.

Total number of trees initially grown = 3
Number of trees that died = 13

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees initially grown - Number of trees that died
Number of trees that survived = 3 - 13

To find the difference between the number of trees that died and the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died.

Difference = Number of trees that died - Number of trees that survived
Difference = 13 - (3 - 13)

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
Difference = 13 - 3 + 13

Calculating the difference:
Difference = 23

Therefore, there were 23 more trees that died in the typhoon than those that survived.

Substituting the given values:

 tDavid's crunches = << tDavid's crunches = 58 - 62 >> 58 - 62 

Simplifying the calculation:

 tDavid's crunches = << tDavid's crunches = -4 >> -4 

Since negative numbers don't make sense in this context, we can conclude that David didn't do any crunches.

Now let's find out how many more crunches than push-ups Zachary did. We can calculate it as:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = tZachary's crunches - tZachary's push-ups >> tZachary's crunches - tZachary's push-ups 

Substituting the given values:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = 58 - 46 >> 58 - 46 

Simplifying the calculation:

 tMore crunches than push-ups = << tMore crunches than push-ups = 12 >> 12 

Therefore, Zachary did 12 more crunches than push-ups.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first.

Let's represent the number of peaches Jill has as ""J"". According to the information given, Steven has 67 more peaches than Jill, so we can express this as ""S = J + 67"".

Since Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, we can represent the number of peaches Jake has as ""K"" and express it as ""K = S - 4"".

Now let's substitute the value of S from equation (2) into equation (3):

K = (J + 67) - 4

Simplifying this equation:

K = J + 63

We know that Steven has 12 peaches, so we can substitute S with 12 in equation (2):

12 = J + 67

Subtracting 67 from both sides of the equation:

J = -55

Now we can substitute J with -55 in equation (4) to find out how many peaches Jake has:

K = (-55) + 63

Simplifying this equation:

K = 8

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.

nell collects baseball cards . she had 566 cards while jeff had 234 cards . she gave some of her cards to jeff and now has 535 cards left . how many cards does jeff have now ?,"Let's denote the number of cards Nell gave to Jeff as ""x"". 

Initially, Nell had 566 cards and Jeff had 234 cards. After Nell gave some cards to Jeff, she now has 535 cards left. 

So, we can set up the equation: 
566 - x = 535

To find the value of ""x"", we can subtract 535 from both sides of the equation: 
566 - x - 535 = 535 - 535
31 - x = 0

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by subtracting 31 from both sides of the equation: 
31 - x - 31 = 0 - 31
-x = -31

To isolate ""x"", we multiply both sides of the equation by -1 (to change the sign): 
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-31)
x = 31

Therefore, Nell gave Jeff 31 cards. 

To find out how many cards Jeff has now, we can add the number of cards he initially had (234) to the number of cards Nell gave him (31): 
234 + 31 = ####

Jeff now has #### cards.

1. Jill has 12 peaches.
2. Steven has 15 more peaches than Jill.
3. Jake has 16 fewer peaches than Steven.

To find out how many more peaches Jill has than Jake, we need to determine the difference between their quantities of peaches.

First, let's calculate how many peaches Steven has:
 Steven = << Steven = Jill + 15 >> Jill + 15 

Substituting the value of Jill's peaches:
 Steven = << Steven = 12 + 15 >> 12 + 15

First, let's find the average number of visitors per day. We know that on one particular day there were 557 visitors and on the previous day there were 188 visitors. To find the total number of visitors for these two days, we can add these two numbers together: 

557 + 188 = <<557 + 188 = 745>> 745

Now, we divide this total number of visitors by the number of days (2) to find the average number of visitors per day:

745 / 2 = <<745 / 2 = 372.5>> 372.5

Since we cannot have half a visitor, we round this number to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the average number of visitors per day is 373.

Finally, to find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 57 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by the number of days:

373 * 57 = <<373 * 57 = 21261>> 21261

a chef had 40 apples and 54 peaches . after making some pies he had 39 left . how many apples did he use ?,"Let's assume the chef used ""x"" number of apples to make pies. 

Initially, the chef had 40 apples and 54 peaches, so the total number of fruits he had is 40 + 54 = 94.

After making some pies, he had 39 fruits left, which means he used a total of 94 - 39 = 55 fruits (apples and peaches combined) to make pies.

To find out how many apples he used, we need to subtract the number of peaches used from the total number of fruits used. Let's say he used ""y"" number of peaches.

So, the equation becomes x + y = 55.

Since we know that the chef initially had 40 apples, we can substitute x with 40 in the equation: 40 + y = 55.

By subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get y = 55 - 40 = 15.

Therefore, the chef used 15 peaches to make pies.

To find out how many apples he used, we can substitute y with 15 in the equation: x + 15 = 55.

By subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 55 - 15 = ####.

According to the given information, there are 458 more girls than boys. Therefore, the number of girls can be represented as << b + 458 >>. We also know that there are 692 girls in the school. 

So we can set up an equation: 

 b + 458 = << b + 458 = 692 >> 692 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of boys and girls together. 

 b + (b + 458) = << b + (b + 458) = b + b + 458 = 2b + 458 >> b + b + 458 = 2b + 458 

Now we can solve for << b >> by subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation: 

 (2b + 458) - 458 = << (2b + 458) - 458 = 692 - 458 >> 692 - 458 

Simplifying this equation gives us:

To isolate << b >>, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 

 2 / b2 = << 2 / b2 = 2 / 34}2 >> 2 / 34}2 

Simplifying further gives us: 

 b = << b = 117 >> 117 

Therefore, there are 117 boys in the school. To find the total number of pupils, we substitute this value back into our earlier equation:

 2b + 458 = << 2b + 458 = (2 * 117) + 458 >> (2 * 117) + 458 

Simplifying this equation gives us:

Now, we are given that together with the other games, they earned >>22. Since we know that the ring toss game made <<x>> dollars per day, we can subtract <<x>> from <<22>> to find out how much the other games made:

<<22 - x>>

The total earnings from all games should be equal to <<420>>, so we can set up another equation:

x + (22 - x) = <<x + (22 - x) = 420>> 420

Simplifying this equation, we get:

22 = <<22 = 420>> 420

This equation is not possible since it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there seems to be an error or inconsistency in the information provided in the question.

lucy went to the grocery store . she bought 2 packs of cookie and 12 packs of cake . in the end she had 56 amount of change remaining . how many packs of groceries did she buy in all ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake.
2. We need to find out how many packs of groceries she bought in total.
3. To do that, we can add the number of packs of cookies and the number of packs of cake together.
4. So, we have 2 + 12 = <<2 + 12 = 14>> 14 packs of groceries.
5. However, we also know that Lucy had 56 units of change remaining.
6. This means that the total cost of all the groceries she bought was equal to the amount she initially had plus the change she received back.
7. Let's assume the initial amount Lucy had was X units.
8. Therefore, we can write an equation: X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining) = total cost of groceries.
9. Since we don't know the value of X, we cannot directly calculate the total cost of groceries.
10. However, we can still determine the number of packs of groceries Lucy bought by using the information from step 4.
11. We know that each pack of groceries costs the same amount, so if we divide the total cost by the cost per pack, we will get the number of packs.
12. Let's assume each pack costs Y units.
13. Now we can write another equation: Y (cost per pack) * 14 (total number of packs) = X (initial amount) + 56 (change remaining).
14. Simplifying this equation gives us: 14Y = X + 56.
15. Since we don't know the values of X or Y, we cannot directly solve this equation for either variable.
16. However, we can make an assumption about Y to find a solution.
17. Let's assume each pack costs Z units, where Z is a positive integer greater than zero.
18. Now we can rewrite the equation as: 14Z = X + 56.
19. By substituting Z with different positive integers, we can find a solution where X is also a positive integer greater than zero.
20. Let's try Z = 4.
21. Substituting Z = 4 into the equation gives us: 14 * 4 = X + 56.
22. Simplifying this equation gives us: 56 = X + 56.
23. Subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation gives us: X = 0

frank was reading through some books . each book had 249 pages and it took frank 3 days to finish each book . how many pages did he read per day ?,"To find out how many pages Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of pages he read by the number of days it took him to finish the books.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Frank read. Since each book had 249 pages and he finished multiple books, we can multiply the number of pages per book by the number of books he finished. Let's assume he finished ""n"" books.

Total number of pages = 249 * n

Next, we need to determine how many days it took Frank to finish the books. According to the information given, it took him 3 days to finish each book. Since he finished ""n"" books, we can multiply the number of days per book by the number of books he finished.

Total number of days = 3 * n

Finally, to find out how many pages Frank read per day, we divide the total number of pages by the total number of days.

Pages read per day = (249 * n) / (3 * n)

Simplifying this expression, we can cancel out the ""n"" terms:

Pages read per day = 249 / 3

Now let's calculate this value:

Pages read per day = << 249 / 3 >>

Pages read per day = << 83 >>

there are 544 pots in each of the 10 gardens . each pot has 32 flowers in it . how many flowers are there in all ?,"To find the total number of flowers in all the gardens, we need to multiply the number of pots in each garden by the number of flowers in each pot and then multiply that by the number of gardens.

Number of pots in each garden = 544
Number of flowers in each pot = 32
Number of gardens = 10

Total number of flowers = (Number of pots in each garden) * (Number of flowers in each pot) * (Number of gardens)

Total number of flowers = 544 * 32 * 10

Calculating this expression:

544 * 32 = 17408
17408 * 10 = 174080

Therefore, there are a total of 174080 flowers in all the gardens.

debby bought 95 soda bottles and 180 water bottles when they were on sale . if she drank 15 water bottles and 54 soda bottles a day how many days would the water bottles last ?,"To find out how many days the water bottles would last, we need to divide the total number of water bottles by the number of water bottles consumed per day.

First, let's calculate the total number of water bottles remaining after Debby drank some:

Total number of water bottles = Number of water bottles bought - Number of water bottles drank
Total number of water bottles = 180 - 15

Next, let's calculate the number of days the remaining water bottles would last:

Number of days = Total number of water bottles / Number of water bottles drank per day
Number of days = (180 - 15) / 15

Given:
- Number of chapters in the book = 2
- Number of pages in each chapter = 405
- Total number of days taken to finish the book = 664

First, let's calculate the total number of pages in the book by multiplying the number of chapters by the number of pages in each chapter:

 tTotal number of pages = << tTotal number of pages = 2 * 405 >> 2 * 405 

Next, we can find out how many pages Frank read per day by dividing the total number of pages by the total number of days:

 tPages read per day = << tPages read per day = \ / textTotal number of pages}t{Total number of days} >> \ / textTotal number of pages}t{Total number of days} 

Finally, since each chapter has the same number of pages, we can determine how many chapters Frank read per day by dividing the pages read per day by the number of pages in each chapter:

 tChapters read per day = << tChapters read per day = \ / textPages read per day}t{Number of pages in each chapter} >> \ / textPages read per day}t{Number of pages in each chapter} 

Now let's calculate these values step by step:

paul had 50 books . after buying some in a garage sale he had 151 left . how many books did he buy ?,"Let's assume that Paul bought x books in the garage sale. 

Initially, Paul had 50 books. After buying x books in the garage sale, he had 151 left. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

50 - x = 151

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation: 

- x = 151 - 50

Simplifying the right side: 

- x = 101

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: 

x = -1 * 101

Simplifying: 

x = -101

However, since we are dealing with a number of books, it doesn't make sense for x to be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or our assumptions.

1. Dave had 21 apps on his phone.
2. He added 89 new apps.
3. After deleting some apps, he had 24 left.

To find out how many more apps Dave added than he deleted, we need to determine the number of apps he deleted.

4. Let's assume Dave deleted x apps.
5. Therefore, the total number of apps after deleting would be 21 + 89 - x = 24.

Now we can solve for x:

6. Simplifying the equation: 110 - x = 24.
7. Subtracting 110 from both sides: -x = -86.
8. Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x: x = 86.

So, Dave deleted 86 apps.

he then went to see the oranges being harvested . he found out that they harvest 8 sacks per day . how many days will it take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges ?,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's assume that the number of days required to harvest 24 sacks is represented by the variable <<d>>. We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day, so we can set up the following proportion:

8 / 1 = <<8 / 1 = 2 / 4d>> 2 / 4d

To solve for <<d>>, we can cross-multiply:

8  d = <<8  d = 24  1>> 24  1

Simplifying the equation:

8d = <<8d = 24>> 24

Now, let's solve for <<d>> by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

8 / d8 = <<8 / d8 = 2 / 48>> 2 / 48

d = <<d = 3>> 3

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.

after resting they decided to go for a swim . the depth of the water is 15 times dean 's height . dean is 4 feet taller than ron . if ron stands at 13 feet how deep was the water ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. The depth of the water is 15 times Dean's height.
2. Dean is 4 feet taller than Ron.
3. Ron stands at 13 feet.

To find out how deep the water is, we need to determine Dean's height first.

Since Ron stands at 13 feet and Dean is 4 feet taller, Dean's height can be calculated by adding 4 to Ron's height:

Dean's height = Ron's height + 4
Dean's height = 13 + 4
Dean's height = 17 feet

Now that we know Dean's height, we can calculate the depth of the water by multiplying it by 15:

Depth of water = Dean's height * 15
Depth of water = 17 * 15
Depth of water = 255 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 255 feet.

after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the buckingham palace on the previous day . if there were 246 visitors on that day how many visited the buckingham palace within 25 days ?,"To find out how many visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within 25 days, we need to determine the average number of visitors per day and then multiply it by 25.

Given that there were 703 visitors on the previous day and 246 visitors on that specific day, we can calculate the total number of visitors for those two days.

Total visitors = Visitors on previous day + Visitors on specific day
Total visitors = 703 + 246

Now, we can find the average number of visitors per day by dividing the total number of visitors by the number of days (2 in this case).

Average visitors per day = Total visitors / Number of days
Average visitors per day = (703 + 246) / 2

Finally, to determine the number of visitors within 25 days, we multiply the average number of visitors per day by 25.

Number of visitors within 25 days = Average visitors per day * Number of days
Number of visitors within 25 days = ((703 + 246) / 2) * 25

Calculating this expression will give us the final answer.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail. The mailman has to give 30 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. So, the total number of pieces of junk mail is <<30 * 78>>.

30 * 78 = <<30 * 78 = 2340>> 2340

Now, let's calculate the total number of houses. We are given that there are 19 houses on a block, and there are 78 blocks in total. So, the total number of houses is <<19 * 78>>.

19 * 78 = <<19 * 78 = 1482>> 1482

Finally, to find out how many pieces of junk mail the mailman should give each house, we need to divide the total number of pieces of junk mail by the total number of houses.

2 / 340}1482 = <<2 / 340}1482 = 1.578>> 1.578

Since we cannot distribute fractional pieces of junk mail, we round down to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the mailman should give each house 1 piece of junk mail.

there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase . how many more roses than orchids are there in the vase now ?,"Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut from her flower garden as <<x>>, and the number of orchids she cut as <<y>>. 

Initially, there were 5 roses and 3 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 12 roses and 2 orchids in the vase. 

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) The number of roses: 5 + x = <<5 + x = 12>> 12
2) The number of orchids: 3 + y = <<3 + y = 2>> 2

To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses.

Substituting the values from equation (1) into equation (2), we have:

3 + y = <<3 + y = 2>> 2
y = <<y = 2 - 3>> 2 - 3
y = <<y = -1>> -1

Since it is not possible to have a negative number of orchids, we can conclude that Jessica did not cut any orchids from her flower garden.

Now, substituting the value of <<y>> into equation (1), we have:

5 + x = <<5 + x = 12>> 12
x = <<x = 12 - 5>> 12 - 5
x = <<x = 7>> 7

Therefore, Jessica cut 7 more roses from her flower garden.

To find out how many more roses than orchids are in the vase now, we subtract the number of orchids from the number of roses:

there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase . how many more orchids than roses are there in the vase now ?,"Let's start by finding the initial number of roses and orchids in the vase. We are given that there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase.

Next, we are told that Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Let's assume she cut r roses and o orchids.

After cutting these flowers, the total number of roses in the vase becomes 9 + r, and the total number of orchids becomes 6 + o.

Finally, we are given that there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So we can set up the following equations:

9 + r = 3   (equation 1)
6 + o = 13  (equation 2)

To find how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids. Let's solve for r in equation 1 and substitute it into equation 2:

r = 3 - 9
r = -6

Substituting this value of r into equation 2:

6 + o = 13
o = 13 - 6
o = 7

Now we can calculate how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now:

o - r = 7 - (-6)
o - r = 7 + 6
o - r = ####

We are given that Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches, so we have:

P_z = <<P_z = 53>> 53
C_z = <<C_z = 14>> 14

We are also given that David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary, so the number of push-ups David did can be expressed as P_d = <<P_d = P_z + 17>> P_z + 17. Additionally, David did 10 less crunches than Zachary, so the number of crunches David did can be expressed as C_d = <<C_d = C_z - 10>> C_z - 10.

To find out how many push-ups and crunches Zachary did, we need to substitute the values of <<P_d>> and <<C_d>> into the equations above. 

P_d = <<P_d = P_z + 17>> P_z + 17
C_d = <<C_d = C_z - 10>> C_z - 10

Substituting the given values:

- The grasshopper jumped 25 inches.
- The frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to add the distances jumped by each animal.

The frog jumped 18 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can calculate the distance jumped by the frog as 25 + 18 = <<25 + 18 = 43>> 43 inches.

Similarly, the mouse jumped 2 inches farther than the frog, so we can calculate the distance jumped by the mouse as 43 + 2 = <<43 + 2 = 45>> 45 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped a total of 45 inches.

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog, so its distance is <<x + 4>> inches.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance is <<x - 44>> inches.

The total distance covered in the jumping contest is the sum of the distances jumped by each participant. Therefore, we can write the equation:

x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = <<x + (x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19>> 19

Simplifying this equation:

3x - 40 = <<3x - 40 = 19>> 19

Adding 40 to both sides:

3x = <<3x = 59>> 59

Dividing both sides by 3:

x = <<x = 5 / 93>> 5 / 93

Therefore, the frog jumped approximately <<5 / 93>> inches.

Simplifying the equation:

108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

paul had 134 books . after giving 39 books to his friend and selling some books in a garage sale he had 68 books left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Paul initially had 134 books.
2. He gave 39 books to his friend, so he now has 134 - 39 = 95 books.
3. After selling some books in a garage sale, he had 68 books left.
4. Let's assume he sold x books in the garage sale.
5. Therefore, the equation representing the situation is: 95 - x = 68.
6. To find the value of x, we can subtract 68 from both sides of the equation: 95 - x - 68 = 0.
7. Simplifying the equation gives us: 27 - x = 0.
8. To isolate x, we can add x to both sides of the equation: 27 - x + x = x.
9. Simplifying further gives us: 27 = x.

Therefore, Paul sold #### books in the garage sale.

jake has 3 fewer peaches than steven who has 8 more peaches than jill . steven has 5 peaches . how many more peaches does jake have than jill ?,"Let's start by assigning variables to the quantities mentioned in the problem:
Let J = number of peaches Jill has
Let S = number of peaches Steven has
Let K = number of peaches Jake has

According to the problem, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so we can write:
S = J + 8

We are also given that Steven has 5 peaches, so we can substitute this value into the equation above:
5 = J + 8

Now, let's solve for J:
J + 8 = 5
J = 5 - 8
J = -3

Since it doesn't make sense for Jill to have a negative number of peaches, there seems to be an error in the problem statement. Please double-check the information provided and rephrase the question if necessary.

1. Let's assume the number of peaches Jill has as ""x"".
2. According to the given information, Steven has 8 more peaches than Jill, so Steven has ""x + 8"" peaches.
3. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has ""(x + 8) - 12"" peaches.
4. It is also given that Steven has a total of 18 peaches, so we can set up the equation: ""(x + 8) - 12 = 18"".
5. Simplifying the equation: ""x - 4 = 18"".
6. Adding 4 to both sides of the equation: ""x = 22"".

Therefore, Jill has 22 peaches.

steven has 19 peaches . jake has 12 fewer peaches than steven and 72 more peaches than jill . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's break down the information given:

1. Steven has 19 peaches.
2. Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven.
3. Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to determine the number of peaches Jill has first.

Since Jake has 72 more peaches than Jill, we can express this as an equation: Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches.

Now, let's substitute the information we have:

Jill's peaches + 72 = Jake's peaches

We don't know Jill's number of peaches yet, so let's represent it with a variable, say ""x"":

x + 72 = Jake's peaches

Next, we know that Jake has 12 fewer peaches than Steven. Since Steven has 19 peaches, we can express this as an equation: Steven's peaches - 12 = Jake's peaches.

Substituting the known values:

19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

Now we have two equations for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = Jake's peaches
19 - 12 = Jake's peaches

To solve for x and find Jill's number of peaches, we can equate the two expressions for Jake's number of peaches:

x + 72 = 19 - 12

Simplifying the equation:

x + 72 = 7

Subtracting 72 from both sides:

x = -65

Now that we know Jill has -65 peaches (which doesn't make sense in this context), it seems there might be an error or inconsistency in the given information. Please double-check the problem statement or provide any additional details if available.

jake has 84 more apples and 10 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples . how many peaches does jake have ?,"Let's start by finding out how many apples Jake has. We know that Steven has 52 apples, and Jake has 84 more apples than Steven. To find the number of apples Jake has, we can add 84 to the number of apples Steven has.

 52 + 84 = << 52 + 84 = 136 >> 136 

So, Jake has 136 apples.

Next, let's find out how many peaches Jake has. We know that Jake has 10 fewer peaches than Steven, who has 13 peaches. To find the number of peaches Jake has, we can subtract 10 from the number of peaches Steven has.

 13 - 10 = << 13 - 10 = 3 >> 3 

Therefore, Jake has 3 peaches.

there were 106 dollars in olivia 's wallet . after she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left . if she spent 49 dollars at the showroom how much did she spend at the supermarket ?,"Let's assume Olivia spent <<x>> dollars at the supermarket. 

Initially, Olivia had 106 dollars in her wallet. After visiting the supermarket and the showroom, she had 26 dollars left. 

We know that Olivia spent 49 dollars at the showroom, so we can subtract this amount from the total she initially had: 

106 - 49 = <<106 - 49 = 57>> 57

After spending <<x>> dollars at the supermarket, Olivia had 26 dollars left, so we can subtract this amount from what she had after visiting the showroom: 

57 - x = <<57 - x = 26>> 26

To find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket (<<x>>), we can solve this equation for <<x>>: 

x = <<x = 57 - 26>> 57 - 26

Calculating this expression gives us: 

x = <<x = 31>> 31

baker made 170 cakes . he sold 78 of them and bought 31 new cakes . how many more cakes did baker sell than those he bought ?,"To find out how many more cakes Baker sold than those he bought, we need to subtract the number of cakes he bought from the number of cakes he sold.

Baker initially made 170 cakes and sold 78 of them. So, the number of cakes he has left after selling is <<170 - 78>>.

Next, Baker bought 31 new cakes. To find the total number of cakes he has now, we need to add the number of cakes he had left after selling to the number of cakes he bought. 

Therefore, the total number of cakes Baker has now is <<(170 - 78) + 31>>.

To determine how many more cakes Baker sold than those he bought, we subtract the number of cakes he bought from the total number of cakes he has now.

Hence, the answer is <<(170 - 78) + 31 - 31>>.

Given:
Number of sacks harvested per day = 16
Number of oranges in each sack = 57
Total number of sacks to be harvested = 80

First, let's calculate the total number of oranges in 80 sacks:
Total number of oranges = Number of sacks * Number of oranges in each sack
Total number of oranges = 80 * 57

Next, let's calculate the number of days it will take to harvest the total number of oranges:
Number of days = Total number of oranges / Number of sacks harvested per day
Number of days = (80 * 57) / 16

Now, let's simplify this expression:

First, let's calculate the total number of sacks harvested in 51 days. Since they harvest 74 sacks per day, we can multiply this by the number of days:

 74 * 51 = << 74 * 51 = 3774 >> 3774 

So, they will have harvested a total of 3774 sacks in 51 days.

Next, let's calculate the number of discarded sacks in 51 days. They discard 71 sacks per day, so we can multiply this by the number of days:

 71 * 51 = << 71 * 51 = 3621 >> 3621 

Therefore, they will have discarded a total of 3621 sacks in 51 days.

To find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days, we need to subtract the discarded sacks from the total harvested sacks:

 3774 - 3621 = << 3774 - 3621 = #### >> #### 

After performing the subtraction, we find that they will have #### sacks of oranges after 51 days of harvest.

Yesterday, the machine made 13 shirts. Since it can make 8 shirts per minute, we can divide the total number of shirts made by the rate at which the machine produces shirts:

 tMinutes taken yesterday = << tMinutes taken yesterday = 1 / 3 t shirts}8 t{ shirts/minute} >> 1 / 3 t shirts}8 t{ shirts/minute} 

Simplifying this expression gives us:

 tMinutes taken yesterday = << tMinutes taken yesterday = 1.625 t minutes >> 1.625 t minutes 

Today, the machine made 3 shirts. Using the same logic as above, we can calculate the time taken today:

 tMinutes taken today = << tMinutes taken today = 3 / t shirts}8 t{ shirts/minute} >> 3 / t shirts}8 t{ shirts/minute} 

Simplifying this expression gives us:

 tMinutes taken today = << tMinutes taken today = 0.375 t minutes >> 0.375 t minutes 

To find the total time, we add up the minutes taken yesterday and today:

 tTotal minutes worked = << tTotal minutes worked = tMinutes taken yesterday + tMinutes taken today >> tMinutes taken yesterday + tMinutes taken today 

Substituting in the calculated values:

 tTotal minutes worked = << tTotal minutes worked = 1.625 + 0.375 >> 1.625 + 0.375 

Simplifying this expression gives us:

 tTotal minutes worked = << tTotal minutes worked = 2 >> 2

Depth of the water = 10 times Dean's height

To calculate the depth of the water, we can multiply Dean's height by 10:

 9 * 10 = << 9 * 10 = 90 >> 90 

Therefore, the depth of the water is 90 feet.

To find out how much deeper the water is than Dean's height, we subtract Dean's height from the depth of the water:

 90 - 9 = << 90 - 9 = 81 >> 81 

Hence, the water is 81 feet deeper than Dean's height.

the school is planning a field trip . the school has 66 classrooms . there are 102 students in the school and 8 seats on each school bus . if 22 students do n't want to go for the trip how many buses are needed to take the trip ?,"To find out how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to calculate the total number of students who want to go on the trip and then divide that number by the number of seats on each bus.

First, let's calculate the total number of students who want to go on the trip. We start with the total number of students in the school, which is 102, and subtract the number of students who don't want to go on the trip, which is 22.

Total number of students going on the trip = 102 - 22 = 80

Next, we divide the total number of students going on the trip by the number of seats on each bus, which is 8.

Number of buses needed = Total number of students going on the trip / Number of seats on each bus
                     = 80 / 8
                     = 10

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take all the students on the field trip.

jake has 3 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than steven . steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples . how many more apples than peaches does steven have ?,"Let's start by finding out how many peaches and apples Jake has. We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven, so if Steven has 12 peaches, then Jake has 12 - 3 = 9 peaches.

We also know that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven, so if Steven has 15 apples, then Jake has 15 + 10 = 25 apples.

Now let's calculate how many more apples than peaches Steven has. Steven has 12 peaches and 15 apples, so the difference between the number of apples and peaches is 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, Steven has 3 more apples than peaches.

jesse 's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide . if she already has 16 square feet of carpet how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor ?,"To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor, we first need to calculate the total area of the floor.

The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width. In this case, Jesse's room has a length of 11 feet and a width of 15 feet.

So, the total area of the floor is <<11 * 15>> square feet.

Next, we need to subtract the area of the carpet Jesse already has from the total area of the floor to determine how much more carpet she needs.

Subtracting 16 square feet (the area of the carpet she already has) from the total area gives us <<11 * 15 - 16>> square feet.

Calculating this expression gives us #### square feet, which represents how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor.

the razorback t-shirt shop makes $ 23 dollars off each t-shirt sold . during the arkansas and texas tech game they made $ 230 by selling t-shirts . how many t-shirts did they sell ?,"Let's assume the number of t-shirts sold is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the given information, the razorback t-shirt shop makes <<23 off each t-shirt sold. Therefore, the total revenue from selling >>x<< t-shirts can be calculated by multiplying the price per t-shirt (>>23) by the number of t-shirts sold (<<x>>):

<<23x>>

We are also given that they made <<230 by selling t-shirts. This can be set equal to the total revenue:

>>23x = 230<<

To find the value of >>x<<, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 23:

First, let's calculate Lewis's total earnings during the 1181 weeks of harvest. He earns <<491 every week, so we can multiply this amount by the number of weeks:

>>491 * 1181 = <<579,371

Next, let's calculate Lewis's total rent payments during the 1181 weeks. He pays >>216 every week, so we can multiply this amount by the number of weeks:

216 * 1181 = <<216 * 1181 = >> 255,096

To find out how much money Lewis will have at the end of the harvest season, we need to subtract his total rent payments from his total earnings:

matthew had 24 crackers . if matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 3 friends and still had 17 crackers left how many crackers did matthew give to his friends ?,"Let's assume that Matthew gave x number of crackers to each of his 3 friends.

If Matthew had 24 crackers and gave x crackers to each friend, he would have 24 - 3x crackers left.

According to the problem, Matthew still had 17 crackers left after giving some to his friends. So we can set up the equation:

24 - 3x = 17

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

24 - 3x - 17 = 17 - 17
7 - 3x = 0

Next, we can isolate the variable by subtracting 7 from both sides:

7 - 7 - 3x = 0 - 7
-3x = -7

To solve for x, we divide both sides by -3:

(-3x) / (-3) = (-7) / (-3)
x = 7/3

Since we are looking for a whole number of crackers, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Matthew gave each of his friends 2 crackers.

Total = 28

Now, let's calculate how many crackers and cakes each person ate:
Crackers per person = Total number of crackers / Number of friends
Crackers per person = 13 / 28

Cakes per person = Total number of cakes / Number of friends
Cakes per person = 15 / 28

Therefore, each person ate approximately #### crackers and #### cakes.

bobby had 20 pieces of candy . he ate 34 pieces of candy . then he ate 18 more . how many pieces of candy did bobby eat ?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate, we need to add the number of pieces he initially ate to the number of pieces he ate later.

Bobby initially ate 34 pieces of candy.
He later ate 18 more pieces of candy.

To find the total number of pieces Bobby ate, we can add these two numbers together.

34 + 18 = 52

Therefore, Bobby ate 52 pieces of candy.

bobby had 22 pieces of candy . he ate some pieces of candy . then he ate 5 more . if he still has 8 pieces of candy left how many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start ?,"Let's assume that Bobby had eaten x pieces of candy at the start.

After eating some pieces of candy, he had 22 - x pieces of candy left.

Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 = 17 - x pieces of candy left.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

-x = -9

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)

x = 9

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

bobby had 32 pieces of candy . he ate some pieces of candy . if he has 20 pieces of candy left how many pieces of candy did bobby eat ?,"Let's assume that Bobby ate x pieces of candy. 

If Bobby had 32 pieces of candy and he ate x pieces, then the number of pieces he has left can be represented as 32 - x. 

According to the problem, Bobby has 20 pieces of candy left. So we can set up the equation: 

32 - x = 20

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 32 from both sides:

32 - x - 32 = 20 - 32
-x = -12

To solve for x, we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-12)
x = 12

Therefore, Bobby ate 12 pieces of candy.

jake brought 6 balloons to the park . if jake brought 4 more balloons than the number of balloons that allan brought how many balloons did allan bring to the park ?,"Let's assume that the number of balloons Allan brought to the park is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan. So, the number of balloons Jake brought can be represented as <<x + 4>>. 

We also know that Jake brought a total of 6 balloons. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + 4 = <<x + 4 = 6>> 6

To solve for <<x>>, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 

x = <<x = 6 - 4>> 6 - 4

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us: 

x = <<x = 2>> 2

So, Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.

Allan brought 6 balloons and Jake brought 2 balloons initially. Then, Jake bought 3 more balloons at the park.

To calculate the total number of balloons Allan had, we add the initial number of balloons he brought to the additional ones he bought at the park: 6 + 0 = <<6 + 0 = 6>> 6.

To calculate the total number of balloons Jake had, we add the initial number of balloons he brought to the additional ones he bought at the park: 2 + 3 = <<2 + 3 = 5>> 5.

Finally, to find out how many more balloons Allan had than Jake in the park, we subtract the number of balloons Jake had from the number of balloons Allan had: 6 - 5 = <<6 - 5 = 1>> 1.

Therefore, Allan had 1 more balloon than Jake in the park.

According to the given information, he spends 2 hours more on learning English than on learning Chinese. Therefore, he spends <<x + 2>> hours on learning English.

In total, Ryan spends 7 hours on learning English and some more hours on learning Chinese. So, the sum of the hours spent on both subjects should be equal to 7:

x + (x + 2) = <<x + (x + 2) = 7>> 7

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 2 = <<2x + 2 = 7>> 7

Subtracting 2 from both sides:

2x = <<2x = 5>> 5

Ryan spends 4 hours on learning English and 6 hours on learning Chinese every day. 

To find out how many hours he spends on each subject each day, we divide the total number of hours by the number of days:

For English: 4 / 86 = <<4 / 86 = 0.0465>> 0.0465 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

For Chinese: 6 / 86 = <<6 / 86 = 0.0698>> 0.0698 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

Jerry initially had 7 action figures and 2 books on the shelf. 

So, the number of action figures minus the number of books is:

7 - 2 = <<7 - 2 = 5>> 5

Later, Jerry added 4 more books to the shelf. 

Therefore, the final number of books on the shelf is:

1. Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.
2. He added 4 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures became 3 + 4 = 7.
3. Later, he removed some of the old action figures from the shelf.
4. The current number of action figures on the shelf is given as 6.

Initially, Rachel had 4 apples on the tree. She picked some apples, so the number of apples left on the tree is given by 4 - x. 

According to the problem, there are now 2 apples left on the tree. So we can set up the equation:

4 - x = 2

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides:

4 - x - 4 = 2 - 4

Simplifying both sides gives us:

-x = -2

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-2)

Simplifying further gives us:

x = 2

Therefore, Rachel picked 2 apples.

because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . 182 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu . if 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those that suggested mashed potatoes how many students suggested bacon ?,"Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is represented by the variable ""m"". 

According to the problem, there are 182 students who suggested adding mashed potatoes. So we can write:

m = <<m = 182>> 182

It is also mentioned that there were other students who suggested adding bacon to the menu. The problem states that 166 more students suggested adding bacon than those who suggested mashed potatoes. 

So, the number of students who suggested adding bacon can be represented as ""m + 166"".

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested bacon and mashed potatoes combined is:

<<m + (m + 166)>>

Simplifying this expression, we get:

<<2m + 166>>

Since we know that a total of 182 students suggested mashed potatoes, we can set up an equation:

2m + 166 = <<2m + 166 = 182>> 182

To solve for ""m"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 166 from both sides gives us:

2m = <<2m = 182 - 166>> 182 - 166

Simplifying further:

2m = <<2m = 16>> 16

Finally, dividing both sides by 2 gives us the value of ""m"":

m = <<m = 1 / 62>> 1 / 62

m = <<m = 8>> 8

Therefore, 8 students suggested adding mashed potatoes.

To find out how many students suggested bacon, we substitute the value of ""m"" into our expression for the number of students who suggested bacon:

m + 166 = <<m + 166 = 8 + 166>> 8 + 166

Calculating this expression gives us:

m + 166 = <<m + 166 = ####>> ####

To find the number of boys, we can subtract the number of girls from the total number of pupils:

Number of boys = Total number of pupils - Number of girls

1. We know that there are 700 girls in the school.
2. The rest of the students are boys.
3. We also know that there are 142 more boys than girls.

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together.

Let's calculate the number of boys:
- If there are 142 more boys than girls, we can represent this as <<700 + 142>>.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pupils:
- To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of girls and boys: <<700 + (700 + 142)>>.

Simplifying this expression:
- 700 + (700 + 142) = <<700 + (700 + 142) = 700 + 700 + 142>> 700 + 700 + 142.

in a school there are 632 girls and 410 boys . 465 more girls joined the school . how many more girls than boys does the school have ?,"To find out how many more girls than boys the school has, we need to calculate the difference between the number of girls and the number of boys.

First, let's determine the total number of girls in the school after 465 more girls joined. We can do this by adding the initial number of girls to the additional girls who joined:

632 + 465 = <<632 + 465 = 1097>> 1097

So, there are now 1097 girls in the school.

Next, we can subtract the number of boys from the total number of girls to find out how many more girls than boys there are:

1097 - 410 = <<1097 - 410 = 687>> 687

Therefore, the school has 687 more girls than boys.

edward spent 4 to buy books and 3 to buy pens . now he has 12 . how much did edward spend on books and pens ?,"Let's assume the amount Edward spent on books is represented by <<x>> and the amount he spent on pens is represented by <<y>>. 

According to the given information, Edward spent <<4>> to buy books and <<3>> to buy pens. So we can write two equations based on this:

Equation 1: x + y = <<x + y = 12>> 12 (Edward has a total of <<12>> after buying books and pens)
Equation 2: x = <<x = 4 + y>> 4 + y (Edward spent <<4>> on books)

To find the values of <<x>> and <<y>>, we can substitute Equation 2 into Equation 1:

(4 + y) + y = <<(4 + y) + y = 12>> 12

Simplifying this equation, we get:

4 + 2y = <<4 + 2y = 12>> 12

Subtracting <<4>> from both sides:

2y = <<2y = 8>> 8

Dividing both sides by <<2>>, we find:

y = <<y = 4>> 4

Now that we know the value of <<y>>, we can substitute it back into Equation 2 to find the value of <<x>>:

x = <<x = 4 + 4>> 4 + 4

Simplifying this equation, we get:

x = <<x = 8>> 8

Therefore, Edward spent <<8>> on books and <<4>> on pens.

Given:
Math homework pages = 7
Reading homework pages = 11
Biology homework pages = 8

To find the difference between the number of reading and biology homework pages, we can subtract the number of biology homework pages from the number of reading homework pages:

Reading homework pages - Biology homework pages = Difference

11 - 8 = Difference

Performing the subtraction:

11 - 8 = 3

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 13 inches . the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper . how far did the frog jump ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 13 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the frog.

To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to subtract 2 inches from the grasshopper's jump:

3. Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump - 2 inches.

Substituting the value of the grasshopper's jump (13 inches) into the equation:

4. Frog's jump = 13 inches - 2 inches.

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

5. Frog's jump = 11 inches.

Therefore, the frog jumped 11 inches.

#### 11"
the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?,"Let's assume that the distance the frog jumped is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the frog. Therefore, the grasshopper's jump can be represented as <<x + 4>>.

The mouse jumped 44 inches lesser than the frog. Therefore, the mouse's jump can be represented as <<x - 44>>.

Given that the grasshopper jumped 19 inches, we can set up an equation:

(x + 4) + (x - 44) = <<(x + 4) + (x - 44) = 19>> 19

Simplifying this equation:

x + x + 4 - 44 = <<x + x + 4 - 44 = 19>> 19

Combining like terms:

2x - 40 = <<2x - 40 = 19>> 19

Adding 40 to both sides of the equation:

2x = <<2x = 59>> 59

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = <<x = 5 / 92>> 5 / 92

Therefore, the frog jumped <<5 / 92>> inches.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 21 inches . the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the grasshopper jump than the mouse ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Let's represent the distance jumped by the frog as ""x"" inches. 

According to the information given, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x + 25"" inches.

The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x - 16"" inches.

Now, we can calculate how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse by subtracting their distances:

Distance jumped by grasshopper - Distance jumped by mouse
= (x + 25) - (x - 16)

Simplifying this expression:

= x + 25 - x + 16
= x - x + 25 + 16
= 41

Therefore, the grasshopper jumped 41 inches farther than the mouse.

We know that Dan had 3 left with him after he bought the candy bar, so we can set up the equation: 4 - c = <<4 - c = 3>> 3.

To find the value of c>>, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: <<4 - 3 = <<c>>, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation: <<4 - 3 = c>> c.

Simplifying this equation gives us: 1 = <<1 = c>> c.

Therefore, the candy bar cost $1.

The cost of the chocolate is given as 7 and the cost of the candy bar is given as 2. 

So, to find out how much more Dan spent on chocolate than on the candy bar, we can subtract 2 from 7:

7 - 2 = <<7 - 2 = 5>> 5

Therefore, Dan spent $5 more on chocolate than he did on the candy bar.

paul had 108 books . after selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 books left.

According to the problem, he had 62 books left after giving away and selling some books. So we can set up the equation:

(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:

108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:

73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

We know that Paul initially had 136 books and he sold some of them, leaving him with 27 books. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

136 - x = 27

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 27 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

136 - 27 = x

Simplifying the left side gives us: 

109 = x

robin 's hair was 16 inches long . she cut off 11 inches . then it again grew by 12 inches . how long is her hair now ?,"To find out how long Robin's hair is now, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Start with Robin's initial hair length of 16 inches.
2. Subtract the amount she cut off, which is 11 inches.
3. This leaves us with the remaining hair length after cutting, which is 16 - 11 = 5 inches.
4. Add the amount her hair grew by, which is 12 inches.
5. This gives us the final length of her hair, which is 5 + 12 = 17 inches.

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 17 inches long.

steven has 14 peaches . jake has 6 fewer peaches than steven and 3 more peaches than jill . how many peaches does jill have ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We know that Steven has 14 peaches.
2. Jake has 6 fewer peaches than Steven, so we can subtract 6 from the number of peaches Steven has: 14 - 6 = <<14 - 6 = 8>> 8.
3. Jake also has 3 more peaches than Jill, so we can add 3 to the number of peaches Jill has: 8 + 3 = <<8 + 3 = 11>> 11.

Therefore, Jill has 11 peaches.

jake has 84 more apples and 10 fewer peaches than steven . steven has 13 peaches and 52 apples . how many peaches does jake have ?,"nan
#### 3"
jake has 3 fewer peaches and 4 more apples than steven . steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches . how many more apples than peaches does steven have ?,"To find out how many more apples than peaches Steven has, we need to compare the number of apples and peaches he has.

Given information:
Steven has 19 apples and 15 peaches.

We know that Jake has 3 fewer peaches than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of peaches Jake has by subtracting 3 from the number of peaches Steven has.
Peaches Jake has = 15 - 3 = 12

Similarly, Jake has 4 more apples than Steven. So, we can calculate the number of apples Jake has by adding 4 to the number of apples Steven has.
Apples Jake has = 19 + 4 = 23

Now, let's compare the number of apples and peaches Steven has:
Apples - Peaches = 19 - 15 = 4

Therefore, Steven has 4 more apples than peaches.

dave had 21 apps on his phone . he added 89 new apps . after deleting some he had 24 left . how many more apps did he add than he deleted ?,"Let's assume that Dave deleted ""x"" number of apps.

Initially, Dave had 21 apps on his phone. He then added 89 new apps, resulting in a total of 21 + 89 = 110 apps.

After deleting some apps, he had 24 left. Therefore, the equation can be written as:

110 - x = 24

To find the value of ""x,"" we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

110 - x - 24 = 24 - 24
86 - x = 0

To isolate ""x,"" we subtract 86 from both sides:

86 - x - 86 = 0 - 86
-x = -86

Finally, to solve for ""x,"" we multiply both sides by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-86)
x = 86

Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps. To find out how many more apps he added than he deleted, we subtract the number of deleted apps from the number of added apps:

89 - 86 = ####

Dave started with 15 apps on his phone and added 71 new apps, so the total number of apps he had before deleting any would be 15 + 71 = <<15 + 71 = 86>> 86.

After deleting some apps, Dave had 14 left. 

To find out how many more apps Dave deleted than he added, we subtract the number of apps he added from the number of apps he had left: 86 - 14 = <<86 - 14 = 72>> 72.

Therefore, Dave deleted 72 more apps than he added.

Nell initially had 438 baseball cards and 18 10 cards. She then gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 55 10 cards and 178 baseball cards left.

Let's calculate the difference:

Number of baseball cards - Number of 10 cards = Difference

Initial number of baseball cards: 438
Initial number of 10 cards: 18

After giving some cards to Jeff:
Number of remaining baseball cards: 178
Number of remaining 10 cards: 55

Now let's calculate the difference:

Difference = 178 - 55

Calculating the difference:

Given:
Number of books in the 'Crazy Silly School' series = 8
Number of movies in the 'Crazy Silly School' series = 5
Number of movies watched = 19
Number of books read = 16

To calculate the difference between the number of movies and books you have experienced, we can use the following equation:

Dave used 12 tickets to buy toys and 7 more tickets to buy clothes. 

So, the number of tickets used to buy clothes is 12 + 7 = 19.

To find the difference, we subtract the number of tickets used to buy clothes from the number of tickets used to buy toys:

after a typhoon 13 trees in haley 's backyard died . if she had grown 3 trees initially how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived ?,"To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the number of trees that died in the typhoon and the number of trees that survived.

Given:
- Initially, Haley had grown 3 trees.
- After the typhoon, 13 trees in Haley's backyard died.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon.

Total number of trees before the typhoon = Initial trees + Trees that died
Total number of trees before the typhoon = 3 + 13

Now, let's calculate the total number of trees before the typhoon:

3 + 13 = <<3 + 13 = 16>> 16

So, there were a total of 16 trees before the typhoon.

To find the number of trees that survived, we subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees before the typhoon:

Number of trees that survived = Total number of trees before the typhoon - Trees that died
Number of trees that survived = 16 - 13

Now, let's calculate the number of trees that survived:

16 - 13 = <<16 - 13 = 3>> 3

So, there were 3 trees that survived.

To find how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived, we subtract the number of trees that survived from the number of trees that died:

Number of trees that died more than those that survived = Trees that died - Number of trees that survived
Number of trees that died more than those that survived = 13 - 3

Now, let's calculate how many more trees died in the typhoon than those that survived:

13 - 3 = <<13 - 3 = 10>> 10

Therefore, there were 10 more trees that died in the typhoon than those that survived.

#### 10"
after a typhoon 2 trees in haley 's backyard died . if she had grown 11 trees initially how many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died ?,"To find out how many more trees survived the typhoon than those that died, we need to subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees initially.

The total number of trees initially is given as 11.

The number of trees that died is given as 2.

To find the number of trees that survived, we can subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees initially:

11 - 2 = <<11 - 2 = 9>> 9

Therefore, 9 more trees survived the typhoon than those that died.

he then went to see the oranges being harvested . he found out that they harvest 8 sacks per day . how many days will it take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges ?,"To find out how many days it will take to harvest 24 sacks of oranges, we can set up a proportion. 

Let's assume that the number of days required to harvest 24 sacks is represented by ""x"". 

We know that they harvest 8 sacks per day, so the proportion can be set up as:

8 / 1 = <<8 / 1 = 2 / 4x>> 2 / 4x

To solve for ""x"", we can cross-multiply:

8x = <<8x = 24>> 24

Now, let's solve for ""x"" by dividing both sides of the equation by 8:

x = <<x = 2 / 48>> 2 / 48

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, it will take 3 days to harvest 24 sacks of oranges.

jesse 's room is 12 feet long and 11 feet wide . how much longer is her room than it is wide ?,"To find out how much longer Jesse's room is than it is wide, we need to subtract the width from the length.

The length of Jesse's room is given as 12 feet, and the width is given as 11 feet. 

So, to find the difference, we subtract 11 from 12:

12 - 11 = <<12 - 11 = 1>> 1

jesse has 18 square feet of carpet . if her room is 4 feet long and 20 feet wide how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor ?,"To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor, we first need to calculate the area of her room. The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width.

Given that the length of Jesse's room is 4 feet and the width is 20 feet, we can calculate the area as follows:

 tArea = << tArea = tlength * twidth = 4 * 20 = 80 >> tlength * twidth = 4 * 20 = 80  square feet.

Since Jesse already has 18 square feet of carpet, we can subtract this from the total area of the room to determine how much more carpet she needs:

 tMore carpet needed = << tMore carpet needed = tTotal area - tCarpet already owned = 80 - 18 = 62 >> tTotal area - tCarpet already owned = 80 - 18 = 62  square feet.

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 62 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

First, we know that they have 12 sets of tables, and each set has 14 chairs. So the total number of chairs from the sets of tables is <<12 * 14>>.

Next, we are told that there are also 6 extra chairs. 

To find the total number of chairs, we add the number of chairs from the sets of tables to the number of extra chairs: <<(12 * 14) + 6>>.

Calculating this expression gives us the total number of chairs they have for the guests.

there are 142 bananas and 356 oranges in philip 's collection . if the bananas are organized into 47 groups and oranges are organized into 178 groups how big is each group of oranges ?,"To find out how big each group of oranges is, we need to divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups they are organized into.

The total number of oranges in Philip's collection is 356.

The number of groups the oranges are organized into is 178.

To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of groups:

 tSize of each group = << tSize of each group = 3 / 56}178 >> 3 / 56}178 

Simplifying this division:

 tSize of each group = << tSize of each group = 2 >> 2

next on his checklist are wax to stick the feathers together . if he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g total how many grams of wax do the feathers require ?,"To find out how many grams of wax the feathers require, we need to subtract the amount of wax he already has (17 g) from the total amount of wax he needs.

Total amount of wax needed = Amount of wax he already has + Amount of wax required by feathers

Let's denote the amount of wax required by feathers as ""x"".

Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + 17 g = 557 g

To isolate ""x"" on one side of the equation, we need to subtract 17 g from both sides:

x = 557 g - 17 g

Simplifying the right side:

x = 540 g

Hence, the feathers require 540 grams of wax.

being his favorite he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop . he was told by 294 of the pickers that they fill 244 drums of grapes per day and 47 drums of raspberries per day . how many drums of grapes would be filled in 146 days ?,"To find the number of drums of grapes that would be filled in 146 days, we need to multiply the number of drums filled per day by the number of days.

Given:
Number of drums of grapes filled per day = 244
Number of days = 146

To find the total number of drums of grapes filled in 146 days, we can use the formula:

Total number of drums = Number of drums per day * Number of days

Substituting the given values into the formula:

Total number of drums = 244 * 146

Calculating this expression:

Total number of drums = 35624

Therefore, in 146 days, they would fill 35,624 drums of grapes.

if you have 14 cookies in total and 7 bags having equal number of cookies how many cookies does each bag have ?,"To find out how many cookies each bag has, we can divide the total number of cookies by the number of bags. 

Given that there are 14 cookies in total and 7 bags, we can set up the following equation:

 tTotal number of cookies = << tTotal number of cookies = tNumber of bags * tNumber of cookies per bag >> tNumber of bags * tNumber of cookies per bag 

Substituting the given values:

 14 = << 14 = 7 * tNumber of cookies per bag >> 7 * tNumber of cookies per bag 

To solve for the number of cookies per bag, we can divide both sides of the equation by 7:

 1 / 47 = << 1 / 47 = 7 / * tNumber of cookies per bag}7 >> 7 / * tNumber of cookies per bag}7 

Simplifying:

According to the information given, Jessie currently weighs 9 kilograms. After she started jogging, she lost 62 kilograms in the first week and 140 kilograms in the second week.

To find out how much she weighed before starting to jog, we need to subtract the total weight she lost from her current weight.

Total weight lost = weight lost in the first week + weight lost in the second week
Total weight lost = 62 kilograms + 140 kilograms

Now, we can calculate Jessie's weight before starting to jog by adding the total weight lost to her current weight:

Jessie's weight before starting to jog = Current weight + Total weight lost
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + (62 kilograms + 140 kilograms)

Calculating the sum inside the parentheses:
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 9 kilograms + 202 kilograms

Adding the two values together:
Jessie's weight before starting to jog = 211 kilograms

Therefore, Jessie weighed 211 kilograms before starting to jog.

Given:
Total number of animals = 79
Number of hiding snakes = 24
Number of hiding alligators = 51

To find the number of animals that were not hiding, we can subtract the sum of hiding snakes and hiding alligators from the total number of animals.

Number of animals not hiding = Total number of animals - Number of hiding snakes - Number of hiding alligators

Number of animals not hiding = 79 - 24 - 51

Now let's calculate this:

Number of animals not hiding = 79 - 24 - 51
                            = 55 - 51

So Rachel picked a total of 28 apples. 

However, the problem states that there are still 29 apples on the trees. 

To find out how many apples Rachel picked in all, we can subtract the number of apples still on the trees (29) from the total number of apples picked (28).

ed had 10 more marbles than doug . doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 45 marbles how many more marbles did ed have than doug then ?,"Let's represent the number of marbles Doug had as <<D>>. Since Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, we can represent the number of marbles Ed had as <<D + 10>>. 

If Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground, we can subtract 11 from the number of marbles Doug had to find the new number of marbles he has: <<D - 11>>. 

Given that Ed had 45 marbles, we can set up an equation: D + 10 = <<D + 10 = 45>> 45. 

To solve for D>>, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: <<D = <<D>>, we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: <<D = 45 - 10>> 45 - 10. 

Therefore, Doug had D = <<D = 35>> 35 marbles. 

To find out how many more marbles Ed had than Doug, we can subtract the number of marbles Doug had from the number of marbles Ed had: <<(D + 10) - D>>. 

Substituting the value of <<D>>: $(35 + 10) - 35 = 45 - 35 = ####10.

According to the information given, we can write the following equations:

E = <<E = D + 24>> D + 24   (Ed had 24 more marbles than Doug)
D - 27 = <<D - 27 = E + 9>> E + 9   (Doug lost 27 marbles and Ed found 9 more marbles)

We can solve these equations to find the values of <<D>> and <<E>>.

First, let's substitute the value of <<E>> from the first equation into the second equation:

D - 27 = <<D - 27 = (D + 24) + 9>> (D + 24) + 9

Simplifying the equation, we get:

D - 27 = <<D - 27 = D + 33>> D + 33

Next, let's isolate the variable <<D>> by subtracting <<D>> from both sides of the equation:

D - D - 27 = <<D - D - 27 = D + 33 - D>> D + 33 - D

Simplifying further, we get:

-27 = <<-27 = 33>> 33

This equation is not possible to solve, as it leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution to the given problem.

because of the decision sofia asked the students to suggest specific types of food . 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes while others suggested adding bacon to the menu . if 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those that suggested bacon how many students suggested bacon ?,"Let's assume the number of students who suggested adding bacon to the menu as ""x"". 

According to the given information, 457 students suggested adding mashed potatoes. It is also mentioned that 63 more students suggested adding mashed potatoes than those who suggested bacon.

So, the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes can be represented as ""x + 63"".

The total number of students who suggested either mashed potatoes or bacon is the sum of these two groups: x + (x + 63) = 457.

Simplifying this equation, we get: 2x + 63 = 457.

Subtracting 63 from both sides of the equation, we have: 2x = 457 - 63.

Calculating the right side of the equation, we get: 2x = 394.

Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we find: x = 197.

Therefore, the number of students who suggested bacon is 197.

The number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes is given as 450.

The number of students who suggested adding bacon is given as 38.

To find the number of students who did not participate, we can subtract the sum of these two numbers from the total number of choices.

Total number of choices = 66

Number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes = 450

Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 38

Number of students who did not participate = Total number of choices - (Number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes + Number of students who suggested adding bacon)

Edward spent <<6 on books and >>16 on pens, so the total amount he spent can be represented as <<6 + >>16 = <<22. 

Now, we know that after spending this money, Edward has >>19 left. 

So, we can set up the equation: x - 22 = <<22 = >> 19. 

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding 22 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - >>22 + <<22 = <<22 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - >>22 + <<22 = >> 19 + <<22. 

Simplifying this equation gives us: x = >>41. 

Therefore, Edward had $41 before he spent his money.

We know that Zachary did 53 push-ups, so David did 17 more push-ups than Zachary. 

To find the number of push-ups David did, we can add 17 to the number of push-ups Zachary did:

 53 + 17 = << 53 + 17 = 70 >> 70 

So David did 70 push-ups.

Next, let's find out how many crunches David did. We know that Zachary did 14 crunches, and David did 10 less crunches than Zachary.

To find the number of crunches David did, we can subtract 10 from the number of crunches Zachary did:

 14 - 10 = << 14 - 10 = 4 >> 4 

So David did 4 crunches.

Finally, let's summarize the number of push-ups and crunches Zachary did:

Zachary did 53 push-ups and 14 crunches.

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 9 inches and the frog jumped 12 inches . how much farther did the frog jump than the grasshopper ?,"To find out how much farther the frog jumped than the grasshopper, we need to subtract the distance jumped by the grasshopper from the distance jumped by the frog.

Distance jumped by the frog = 12 inches
Distance jumped by the grasshopper = 9 inches

So, the difference in their distances can be calculated as:

Distance jumped by the frog - Distance jumped by the grasshopper = 12 - 9 = 3

Therefore, the frog jumped 3 inches farther than the grasshopper.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"The grasshopper jumped 19 inches.
The frog jumped 10 inches farther than the grasshopper, so the frog jumped 19 + 10 = 29 inches.
The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse jumped 29 + 20 = 49 inches.
To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we subtract the grasshopper's jump from the mouse's jump: 49 - 19 = 30.
Therefore, the mouse jumped 30 inches farther than the grasshopper.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 24 inches . the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference between their respective jumps.

Given:
- The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
- The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.
- The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog.

Let's calculate the frog's jump first:
Frog's jump = Grasshopper's jump + 33 inches
Frog's jump = 24 inches + 33 inches

Now, let's calculate the mouse's jump:
Mouse's jump = Frog's jump - 5 inches
Mouse's jump = (24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches

Finally, let's find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper by calculating the difference between their jumps:
Difference = Mouse's jump - Grasshopper's jump
Difference = [(24 inches + 33 inches) - 5 inches] - 24 inches

Simplifying the calculations:
Frog's jump = <<24 + 33>>
Mouse's jump = <<(24 + 33) - 5>>
Difference = <<[(24 + 33) - 5] - 24>>

Calculating each step:
Frog's jump = <<57>>
Mouse's jump = <<52>>
Difference = <<28>>

Therefore, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 35 inches . the grasshopper jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper . how much did they jump altogether ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 35 inches.
2. The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. To find out how much they jumped altogether, we need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped to the distance the frog jumped.

Let's calculate the distance the frog jumped:
- The frog jumped 4 inches farther than the grasshopper, which means the frog jumped 35 + 4 = 39 inches.

Now, let's calculate the total distance they jumped altogether:
- We need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped (35 inches) to the distance the frog jumped (39 inches).
- 35 + 39 = 74

Therefore, they jumped altogether 74 inches.

Given:
Number of current bird families = 87
Number of new bird families = 18

To find the total number of bird families, we can add these two numbers together:

 87 + 18 = << 87 + 18 = 105 >> 105 

Therefore, there are now 105 bird families living near the mountain.

26 new bird families came to live near the mountain from the arctic. To find the total number of bird families near the mountain now, we add the initial number of bird families to the number of new bird families: 3 + 26 = 29. 

2 bird families flew away further south for winter. To find the final number of bird families near the mountain, we subtract the number of bird families that flew away from the total number of bird families: 29 - 2 = 27. 

Therefore, there are 27 bird families left near the mountain.

paul got a box of 440 crayons for his birthday . during the school year he gave 111 crayons to his friends while he lost 106 crayons . how many crayons did he have left ?,"To find out how many crayons Paul had left, we need to subtract the number of crayons he gave to his friends and the number of crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he received.

Total number of crayons Paul received = 440
Number of crayons Paul gave to his friends = 111
Number of crayons Paul lost = 106

To find the number of crayons Paul had left, we can subtract the sum of the crayons he gave to his friends and the crayons he lost from the total number of crayons he received:

Number of crayons Paul had left = Total number of crayons - Number of crayons given to friends - Number of crayons lost

Number of crayons Paul had left = 440 - 111 - 106

To find the value of <<x>>, we can isolate the variable by adding 9 to both sides of the equation: 

x - 9 + 9 = <<x - 9 + 9 = 12 + 9>> 12 + 9

Simplifying, we have: 

x = <<x = 21>> 21

Therefore, the waiter had 21 customers at the start.

So, we can set up the equation: 

>>2x = 4<<

To find the value of x, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

>>2x/2 = 4/2<<

This simplifies to:

Initially, Paul had 42 pens and after selling some, he had 19 pens left. Therefore, the equation representing this situation can be written as:

42 - x = 19

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation:

42 - x = 19
Subtract 42 from both sides:
42 - 42 - x = 19 - 42
-x = -23

To isolate ""x"", we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1) * (-x) = (-1) * (-23)
x = 23

Therefore, Paul sold 23 pens in the garage sale.

there were 15 roses in the vase . jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase . there are now 17 roses in the vase . how many more roses did she cut than those she threw away ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase.
3. Therefore, the number of roses remaining in the vase after Jessica threw away the roses is 15 - 33 = -18.
4. However, the problem states that there are now 17 roses in the vase.
5. To determine how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to find the difference between the number of roses she cut and the number she threw away.
6. Let's assume the number of roses Jessica cut is represented by the variable ""x"".
7. We can set up the equation: x - 33 = 17.
8. Solving for x, we add 33 to both sides of the equation: x = 17 + 33 = 50.
9. Therefore, Jessica cut 50 roses.
10. To find the difference between the number of roses she cut and the number she threw away, we subtract the number of roses she threw away from the number she cut: 50 - 33 = 17.

Therefore, Jessica cut 17 more roses than she threw away.

robin 's hair was 19 inches long . if she grew 18 more inches how long is her hair now ?,"To find out how long Robin's hair is now, we need to add the length of her hair before she grew 18 more inches.

Given that Robin's hair was initially 19 inches long, we can represent this as:

 tInitial length = << tInitial length = 19 >> 19 

Now, if she grew 18 more inches, we can represent this as:

 tGrowth = << tGrowth = 18 >> 18 

To find the total length of her hair now, we can add the initial length and the growth:

 tTotal length = << tTotal length = tInitial length + tGrowth >> tInitial length + tGrowth 

Substituting the values:

 tTotal length = << tTotal length = 19 + 18 >> 19 + 18 

Performing the addition:

 tTotal length = << tTotal length = 37 >> 37 

Therefore, Robin's hair is now 37 inches long.

We know that Danny found 22 bottle caps at the park, so the total number of bottle caps he had after finding them is <<x + 22>>. 

Similarly, Danny found 8 wrappers at the park, so the total number of wrappers he had after finding them is 8 + 63 = <<8 + 63 = 71>> 71. 

We also know that Danny now has 28 bottle caps and 63 wrappers in his collection. 

To find the initial number of bottle caps Danny had, we can set up the following equation: 

x + 22 = <<x + 22 = 28>> 28

Simplifying the equation, we have: 

x = <<x = 28 - 22>> 28 - 22

x = <<x = 6>> 6

First, let's find the initial difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps. Danny found 10 bottle caps and 62 wrappers at the park. So the initial difference is:

62 - 10 = <<62 - 10 = 52>> 52

Next, let's find the current difference between the number of wrappers and bottle caps. Danny now has 27 bottle caps and 43 wrappers in his collection. So the current difference is:

43 - 27 = <<43 - 27 = 16>> 16

To find out how many more wrappers than bottle caps Danny has now, we need to subtract the initial difference from the current difference:

16 - 52 = <<16 - 52 = -36>> -36

The negative value indicates that Danny has 36 fewer wrappers than bottle caps now. However, since the question asks for the absolute value of the difference, we can ignore the negative sign. Therefore, Danny has 36 more wrappers than bottle caps now.

1. Jake has 7 fewer peaches than Steven.
2. Jake has 8 more peaches than Jill.
3. Steven has 17 peaches.

Let's represent the number of peaches Jake has as J, the number of peaches Steven has as S, and the number of peaches Jill has as Jl.

From the first statement, we can write the equation J = S - 7.

From the second statement, we can write the equation J = Jl + 8.

We also know that S = 17.

Now we can substitute the value of S into the first equation: J = 17 - 7.

Simplifying the equation, we have J = 10.

Substituting the value of J into the second equation: 10 = Jl + 8.

Simplifying the equation, we have Jl = 10 - 8.

Therefore, Jill has 2 peaches.

1. Steven has 12 peaches.
2. Jill has 67 fewer peaches than Steven.

To find out how many peaches Jake has, we need to subtract the number of peaches he has from Steven's total.

3. Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven.

To calculate the number of peaches Jake has, we subtract 4 from the number of peaches Steven has.

4. Jill has 67 fewer peaches than Steven.

To find the number of peaches Steven has, we need to add 67 to the number of peaches Jill has.

Now let's put these steps together to find the number of peaches Jake has:

- Steven has 12 peaches.
- Jill has 67 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jill has 12 - 67 = -55 peaches.
- Jake has 4 fewer peaches than Steven, so Jake has 12 - 4 = 8 peaches.

Therefore, Jake has 8 peaches.

jake has 8 fewer peaches and 10 more apples than steven . steven has 11 apples and 18 peaches . how many more peaches than apples does steven have ?,"To find out how many more peaches than apples Steven has, we first need to determine the number of peaches and apples Jake has.

Given that Jake has 8 fewer peaches than Steven, we can subtract 8 from the number of peaches Steven has:

 18 - 8 = << 18 - 8 = 10 >> 10  peaches (Jake has 10 peaches).

Next, we are told that Jake has 10 more apples than Steven. We can add 10 to the number of apples Steven has:

 11 + 10 = << 11 + 10 = 21 >> 21  apples (Jake has 21 apples).

Now that we know the number of peaches and apples for both Jake and Steven, we can calculate the difference between the number of peaches and apples for Steven:

 18 - 11 = << 18 - 11 = 7 >> 7  (Steven has 7 more peaches than apples).

Therefore, Steven has 7 more peaches than apples. ####

Nell initially had 239 baseball cards and 38 10 cards. She gave some of her cards to Jeff and now has 376 10 cards and 111 baseball cards left.

To find the number of 10 cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the current number of 10 cards from the initial number of 10 cards: 38 10 cards - 376 10 cards = -338 10 cards.

To find the number of baseball cards Nell gave to Jeff, we subtract the current number of baseball cards from the initial number of baseball cards: 239 baseball cards - 111 baseball cards = 128 baseball cards.

Therefore, Nell has 338 more 10 cards than baseball cards.

paco had 8 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies . he ate 20 sweet cookies and 34 salty cookies . how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat ?,"To find out how many more salty cookies Paco ate compared to sweet cookies, we need to subtract the number of sweet cookies Paco ate from the number of salty cookies he ate.

Paco had 8 sweet cookies and ate 20 sweet cookies, so he had 8 - 20 = -12 sweet cookies left.

Paco had 6 salty cookies and ate 34 salty cookies, so he had 6 - 34 = -28 salty cookies left.

To find the difference between the number of salty and sweet cookies Paco ate, we subtract the number of sweet cookies left from the number of salty cookies left: -28 - (-12) = -28 + 12 = -16.

Since we can't have a negative number of cookies, we can conclude that Paco didn't eat more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

marco and his dad went strawberry picking . together they collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds . on the way back marco ' dad lost 8 pounds of strawberries . marco 's strawberries now weighed 12 pounds . how much did his dad 's strawberries weigh now ?,"Let's denote the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as <<x>> pounds. 

According to the information given, Marco and his dad collected strawberries that weighed 36 pounds. This can be expressed as:

12 + x = <<12 + x = 36>> 36

To find the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries after losing 8 pounds, we subtract 8 from the original weight:

x - 8 = <<x - 8 = 36 - 8>> 36 - 8

Simplifying this equation gives us:

x - 8 = <<x - 8 = 28>> 28

To find the value of <<x>>, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 28 + 8>> 28 + 8

Simplifying further:

x = <<x = 36>> 36

Therefore, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 36 pounds.

22 children were riding on the bus . at the bus stop 40 children got on the bus while some got off the bus . then there were 2 children altogether on the bus . how many children got off the bus at the bus stop ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

Step 1: The problem states that initially there were 22 children on the bus.
 tInitial number of children on the bus = << tInitial number of children on the bus = 22 >> 22 

Step 2: At the bus stop, 40 children got on the bus.
 tNumber of children who got on the bus = << tNumber of children who got on the bus = 40 >> 40 

Step 3: After some children got off the bus, there were 2 children remaining on the bus.
 tNumber of children remaining on the bus = << tNumber of children remaining on the bus = 2 >> 2 

Step 4: We need to find how many children got off the bus at the bus stop.
To find this, we can subtract the number of children remaining on the bus from the total number of children who were on the bus initially.
 tNumber of children got off the bus = << tNumber of children got off the bus = tInitial number of children - tNumber of children remaining on the bus >> tInitial number of children - tNumber of children remaining on the bus 

Step 5: Substitute the given values into the equation.
 tNumber of children got off the bus = << tNumber of children got off the bus = 22 - 2 >> 22 - 2 

Step 6: Perform the subtraction.
 tNumber of children got off the bus = << tNumber of children got off the bus = 20 >> 20 

Therefore, 20 children got off the bus at the bus stop.

jesse 's room is 11 feet long and 15 feet wide . if she already has 16 square feet of carpet how much more carpet does she need to cover the whole floor ?,"To find out how much more carpet Jesse needs to cover the whole floor, we first need to calculate the area of Jesse's room. The area of a rectangle can be found by multiplying its length by its width. 

Given that the length of Jesse's room is 11 feet and the width is 15 feet, we can calculate the area as follows:

Area = Length * Width
Area = 11 feet * 15 feet

To find the area, we multiply 11 by 15:

Area = 165 square feet

Now, we subtract the area of the carpet Jesse already has (16 square feet) from the total area of the room (165 square feet) to determine how much more carpet she needs:

Additional carpet needed = Total area - Area of carpet already had
Additional carpet needed = 165 square feet - 16 square feet

To find the additional carpet needed, we subtract 16 from 165:

Additional carpet needed = 149 square feet

Therefore, Jesse needs an additional 149 square feet of carpet to cover the whole floor.

First, let's find the total number of T-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game. We can do this by subtracting the number of T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game from the total number of T-shirts sold during both games.

Total T-shirts sold during both games = 186
T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game = 172

Total T-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = Total T-shirts sold during both games - T-shirts sold during the Arkansas game

Total T-shirts sold during the Texas Tech game = 186 - 172 = ####

Next, let's calculate the total money made from selling T-shirts during both games. We can do this by multiplying the number of T-shirts sold during both games by the amount made from each T-shirt sold.

Total money made from selling T-shirts during both games = Total T-shirts sold during both games * Money made from each T-shirt sold

Total money made from selling T-shirts during both games = 186 * 78 = ####

The razorback shop makes <<192 off each t-shirt and >>34 off each jersey. 

During the Arkansas and Texas Tech game, they sold 157 t-shirts and 19 jerseys.

if lewis earns 1357 every week during the 223 weeks of a harvest season . how much money will he earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons ?,"To find out how much money Lewis will earn if he works for 73 harvest seasons, we need to multiply the amount he earns per week by the number of weeks in a harvest season and then multiply that by the number of harvest seasons.

First, let's calculate the total number of weeks Lewis will work for:
 t{number of weeks in a harvest season} = << t{number of weeks in a harvest season} = 223 >> 223 
 t{number of harvest seasons} = << t{number of harvest seasons} = 73 >> 73 
 t{total number of weeks} = << t{total number of weeks} = t{number of weeks in a harvest season} * t{number of harvest seasons} = 223 * 73 >> t{number of weeks in a harvest season} * t{number of harvest seasons} = 223 * 73 

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Lewis will earn:
 t{amount earned per week} = << t{amount earned per week} = 1357 >> 1357 
 t{total amount earned} = << t{total amount earned} = t{amount earned per week} * t{total number of weeks} = 1357 * (t{number of weeks in a harvest season} * t{number of harvest seasons}) >> t{amount earned per week} * t{total number of weeks} = 1357 * (t{number of weeks in a harvest season} * t{number of harvest seasons}) 

Now, let's compute the total amount of money Lewis will earn:
 t{total amount earned} = << t{total amount earned} = 1357 * (223 * 73) >> 1357 * (223 * 73)

- The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height.
- Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron.
- Ron stands at 12 feet.

To find:
- The depth of the water.

Solution:
Let's first find Dean's height. Since Dean is 11 feet shorter than Ron, Dean's height would be Ron's height minus 11 feet.
Dean's height = Ron's height - 11
Dean's height = 12 - 11
Dean's height = 1 feet

Now, let's find the depth of the water. The depth of the water is 5 times Ron's height.
Depth of water = 5 * Ron's height
Depth of water = 5 * 12
Depth of water = 60 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 60 feet.

Given that Ron is 15 feet tall, we can determine Dean's height by subtracting 6 feet from Ron's height. 

Dean's height = Ron's height - 6
Dean's height = 15 - 6
Dean's height = 9 feet

Next, we are told that the depth of the water is 9 times Dean's height. 

Depth of water = 9 * Dean's height
Depth of water = 9 * 9
Depth of water = 81 feet

Therefore, the depth of the water is 81 feet.

Given:
Number of books = 34
Number of bookshelves = 2

To find the number of books in each bookshelf, we need to divide the total number of books by the number of bookshelves:

Number of books in each bookshelf = Total number of books / Number of bookshelves

Plugging in the given values:

Number of books in each bookshelf = 34 / 2

Simplifying the division:

Number of books in each bookshelf = 17

Therefore, there are 17 books in each bookshelf.

bryan took a look at his books as well . each bookshelf contains 2 books . if he has a total of 38 books how many bookshelves does he have ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1) We know that each bookshelf contains 2 books.
2) Let's assume the number of bookshelves is represented by the variable ""x"".
3) The total number of books can be calculated by multiplying the number of bookshelves by the number of books per bookshelf, which is 2. So, the equation can be written as:

2 * x = 38

4) To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

(2 * x) / 2 = 38 / 2

5) Simplifying the equation:

x = 19

Therefore, Bryan has 19 bookshelves.

melissa scored 109 points in each game . she also got 82 bonus points in each game . how many points did she score in 79 games ?,"Melissa scored 109 points in each game and got 82 bonus points in each game. To find out how many points she scored in 79 games, we need to multiply the total points scored in each game by the number of games played.

Total points scored in each game = 109 + 82 = 191
Number of games played = 79

To find the total points scored in 79 games, we multiply the total points scored in each game by the number of games played:

Total points scored = 191 * 79

Calculating this, we get:

Total points scored = 15189

the ferris wheel in paradise park has some seats . each seat can hold 9 people . if 18 people can ride the wheel at the same time how many seats does the ferris wheel have ?,"To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel, we can divide the total number of people who can ride the wheel by the number of people each seat can hold.

Given:
Number of people who can ride the wheel at the same time = 18
Number of people each seat can hold = 9

To find the number of seats on the Ferris wheel:
Number of seats = Number of people who can ride the wheel / Number of people each seat can hold

Number of seats = 18 / 9

Calculating the division:
Number of seats = 2

Therefore, the Ferris wheel has 2 seats.

the ferris wheel in paradise park has 18 seats . each seat can hold 15 people . if 10 seats are broken how many people can ride the ferris wheel at the same time ?,"To find the number of people that can ride the ferris wheel at the same time, we need to subtract the number of broken seats from the total number of seats on the ferris wheel.

The total number of seats on the ferris wheel is given as 18.

The number of broken seats is given as 10.

To find the number of people that can ride the ferris wheel at the same time, we need to subtract the number of broken seats from the total number of seats:

paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 36 seeds . they put 12 seeds in each flower bed and only 58 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed . how many flower beds did they have ?,"To find the number of flower beds, we need to divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed.

Total number of seeds planted = 36
Number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed = 58

To find the number of flower beds, we divide the total number of seeds planted by the number of seeds that grew into flowers in each flower bed:

36 / 58 = 0.62 (rounded to two decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fraction of a flower bed, we round the decimal to the nearest whole number:

0.62 rounds to 1

matthew had 15 crackers . if matthew gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends and still had 10 crackers left how many crackers did each friend eat ?,"Matthew had 15 crackers and gave equal numbers of crackers to his 5 friends. Let's represent the number of crackers each friend ate as ""x"". Therefore, Matthew gave away a total of 5x crackers. After giving away these crackers, Matthew still had 10 crackers left.

To find the value of ""x"", we can set up the equation:

15 - 5x = 10

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

15 - 10 = 5x

5 = 5x

To isolate ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

5/5 = x

Therefore, each friend ate x = 1 cracker.

Since Matthew gave an equal number of crackers and cakes to his 4 friends, we can assume that each friend received the same number of cakes.

First, let's calculate the total number of cakes Matthew gave to his friends. We know that Matthew initially had 8 cakes and he gave an equal number to each friend. So, the total number of cakes given to friends is <<8 / 4>>.

8 / 4 = <<8 / 4 = 2>> 2

Each friend received 2 cakes. 

Therefore, each person ate 2 cakes.

First, let's calculate the total number of soda bottles remaining after Debby drank 4 soda bottles a day:
 256 - 4 = << 256 - 4 = 252 >> 252 .

Next, we can find the number of days the soda bottles would last by dividing the remaining soda bottles by the number of soda bottles consumed per day:
 2 / 52}4 = << 2 / 52}4 = 63 >> 63 .

Therefore, the soda bottles would last for 63 days.

the school is planning a field trip . the school has 72 classrooms . there are 3 seats on each school bus . if there are a total of 111 students in the school how many buses are needed to take the trip ?,"To find out how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus.

First, we need to find the total number of seats available on all the buses. Since there are 3 seats on each bus, we can calculate the total number of seats by multiplying the number of buses by 3.

Since we don't know the number of buses needed yet, let's represent it as ""x"". Therefore, the total number of seats is 3x.

We are given that there are 111 students in the school. To find the number of buses needed, we can set up the equation:

3x = 111

Now, we need to solve for ""x"". To do that, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

(3x)/3 = 111/3

Simplifying the equation gives us:

x = 37

Therefore, 37 buses are needed to take the field trip.

Total number of bananas = 203
Number of groups = 7

To find the size of each group of bananas, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:

Size of each group of bananas = Total number of bananas / Number of groups

Size of each group of bananas = 203 / 7

Calculating this division, we find that each group of bananas has approximately 29 bananas.

you had 26 bags with equal number of cookies . if you had 15 candies and 52 cookies in total how many bags of cookies do you have ?,"Let's assume the number of cookies in each bag is represented by the variable <<x>>.

Since you had 26 bags with an equal number of cookies, the total number of cookies is given by <<26x>>.

You also had 15 candies, which are not cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies and candies is <<26x + 15>>.

We know that the total number of cookies and candies is 52. So we can set up the equation 26x + 15 = <<26x + 15 = 52>> 52.

To solve for x>>, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: <<26x = <<x>>, we can subtract 15 from both sides of the equation: <<26x = 52 - 15>> 52 - 15.

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us 26x = <<26x = 37>> 37.

To isolate x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26: <<x = <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26: <<x = 3 / 726>> 3 / 726.

Simplifying the fraction gives us x = <<x = 1.42>> 1.42 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, each bag contains approximately 1.42 cookies.

To find the number of bags of cookies you have, we can divide the total number of cookies (52) by the number of cookies in each bag (1.42):

52 / 1.42 = <<52 / 1.42 = 36.62>> 36.62 (rounded to two decimal places).

Therefore, you have approximately 36.62 bags of cookies.

On Monday, Julia played with 5 kids.
On Wednesday, Julia played with 15 kids.

To find the total number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Wednesday, we add these two numbers together:

5 + 15 = <<5 + 15 = 20>> 20

Therefore, Julia played with 20 kids on Monday and Wednesday.

julia played tag with 15 kids on monday 18 kids on tuesday and 7 kids on wednesday . how many more kids did she play with on monday and tuesday than on wednesday ?,"To find out how many more kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday, we need to calculate the total number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday, and then subtract the number of kids she played with on Wednesday.

The number of kids Julia played with on Monday is 15.
The number of kids Julia played with on Tuesday is 18.
The number of kids Julia played with on Wednesday is 7.

To find the total number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday, we add the number of kids she played with on each day: 15 + 18 = 33.

To find the difference between the total number of kids Julia played with on Monday and Tuesday and the number of kids she played with on Wednesday, we subtract the number of kids she played with on Wednesday from the total: 33 - 7 = 26.

Therefore, Julia played with 26 more kids on Monday and Tuesday than on Wednesday.

julia played tag with 12 kids on monday . she played tag with 14 kids on tuesday . she spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days . how many kids did she play with altogether ?,"Let's assume that Julia played with x kids on Monday and y kids on Tuesday.

According to the given information, Julia played tag with 12 kids on Monday, so we can write the equation:
x = 12

Similarly, Julia played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday, so we can write the equation:
y = 14

We also know that Julia spent a total of 34 hours to play tag on both days. We can write the equation:
x + y = 34

Now, we can substitute the values of x and y from the first two equations into the third equation:
12 + 14 = 34

Simplifying the equation, we get:
26 = 34

This equation is not true, which means there is no solution that satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, we cannot determine how many kids Julia played with altogether.

bobby ate some pieces of candy . then he ate 25 more . if he ate a total of 43 pieces of candy how many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start ?,"Let's assume that Bobby had eaten x pieces of candy at the start. Then, after eating 25 more pieces, he would have eaten a total of x + 25 pieces of candy. We are given that he ate a total of 43 pieces of candy, so we can set up the equation:

x + 25 = 43

To solve for x, we can subtract 25 from both sides of the equation:

x + 25 - 25 = 43 - 25

This simplifies to:

x = 18

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 18 pieces of candy at the start.

bobby ate 28 pieces of candy . then he ate 42 more . he also ate 63 pieces of chocolate . how many pieces of candy did bobby eat ?,"To find out how many pieces of candy Bobby ate, we need to add up the number of candy pieces he ate initially and the number of candy pieces he ate later.

Bobby initially ate 28 pieces of candy.
Bobby later ate 42 more pieces of candy.

To find the total number of candy pieces Bobby ate, we add the initial amount and the additional amount: 28 + 42 = 70.

Therefore, Bobby ate 70 pieces of candy.

Bobby had 21 pieces of candy.
He ate 5 pieces of candy.
So, he now has 21 - 5 = 16 pieces of candy left.

Then, he ate 9 more pieces of candy.
To find out how many pieces of candy he has left now, we subtract 9 from the previous result.
16 - 9 = 7

Therefore, Bobby has 7 pieces of candy left.

10 red peaches and some more green peaches are in the basket . if there are a total of 15 peaches in the basket how many green peaches are in the basket ?,"Let's assume the number of green peaches in the basket is represented by the variable << g >>. 

According to the problem, there are 10 red peaches in the basket. So, we can write an equation to represent the total number of peaches in the basket:

 10 + g = << 10 + g = 15 >> 15 

To find the value of << g >>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 10 from both sides:

jerry had 3 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added 4 more action figures to the shelf and removed some of the old ones . if there are 6 action figures on his shelf now how many action figures did he remove from the shelf ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. Jerry initially had 3 action figures on the shelf.
2. He added 4 more action figures to the shelf, so the total number of action figures became 3 + 4 = 7.
3. Later, he removed some of the old action figures from the shelf.
4. The current number of action figures on the shelf is given as 6.
5. To find out how many action figures Jerry removed, we need to subtract the current number (6) from the total number (7).

6 birds were sitting on the fence . 4 more birds and 8 more storks came to join them . how many birds are sitting on the fence ?,"There were initially 6 birds sitting on the fence. 

Then, 4 more birds joined them, making a total of 6 + 4 = 10 birds on the fence.

Additionally, 8 more storks came to join them. However, since the question only asks for the number of birds sitting on the fence, we can ignore the storks.

Therefore, there are 10 birds sitting on the fence.

#### 10"
6 storks and 2 birds were sitting on the fence . 3 more birds came to join them . how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence ?,"To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we first need to determine the total number of storks and birds on the fence.

Given that there are 6 storks and 2 birds initially sitting on the fence, we can calculate the total number of storks and birds by adding these two quantities together:

6 + 2 = <<6 + 2 = 8>> 8

So, there are a total of 8 storks and birds on the fence.

Next, we are told that 3 more birds came to join them. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to compare the number of storks to the number of birds after the additional birds arrived.

Since only birds joined, the number of storks remains the same at 6. However, we need to add the additional 3 birds to the initial 2 birds:

2 + 3 = <<2 + 3 = 5>> 5

Therefore, after the additional birds arrived, there are now 5 birds on the fence.

To determine how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks:

6 - 5 = <<6 - 5 = 1>> 1

Hence, there is one more stork than bird sitting on the fence.

3 birds were sitting on the fence . 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them . how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence ?,"Initially, there were 3 birds sitting on the fence. Then, 6 more storks and 2 more birds came to join them. To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we need to compare the number of storks and birds.

The number of storks is given by the initial number of storks plus the additional 6 storks: 3 + 6 = <<3 + 6 = 9>> 9 storks.

The number of birds is given by the initial number of birds plus the additional 2 birds: 3 + 2 = <<3 + 2 = 5>> 5 birds.

To find out how many more storks than birds are sitting on the fence, we subtract the number of birds from the number of storks: 9 - 5 = <<9 - 5 = 4>> 4.

Therefore, there are 4 more storks than birds sitting on the fence.

a book has 2 chapters . the first chapter is 60 pages long . if there are a total of 93 pages in the book how many pages are in the second chapter ?,"To find the number of pages in the second chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the first chapter from the total number of pages in the book.

Given:
Number of chapters = 2
Number of pages in the first chapter = 60
Total number of pages in the book = 93

Let's denote the number of pages in the second chapter as ""x"".

We know that:
Number of pages in the first chapter + Number of pages in the second chapter = Total number of pages in the book

Therefore, we can write the equation:
60 + x = 93

To solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 60 from both sides:

60 + x - 60 = 93 - 60
x = 33

Hence, there are 33 pages in the second chapter.

We know that Rachel picked 3 ripe apples from the tree. After picking, the tree has 2 ripe apples left. 

So, if we add the 3 ripe apples Rachel picked to the 2 remaining on the tree, we can determine the initial number of ripe apples.

 3 + 2 = << 3 + 2 = 5 >> 5 

Therefore, the tree initially had 5 ripe apples.

To find out how many apples are on the tree now, we need to add the number of apples Rachel picked (4) to the initial number of apples (2). 

2 + 4 = <<2 + 4 = 6>> 6

After Rachel picked the apples, 3 new apples grew on the tree. To find out how many apples are on the tree now, we need to add these 3 new apples to the previous total.

1. Let's assume that Doug had ""x"" marbles.
2. According to the given information, Ed had 10 more marbles than Doug, so Ed had ""x + 10"" marbles.
3. Doug lost 11 of his marbles at the playground, which means he now has ""x - 11"" marbles.
4. We are also given that Ed had 45 marbles, so we can set up the equation: ""x + 10 = 45"".
5. Solving this equation will give us the value of ""x"", which represents the number of marbles Doug initially had.
6. Subtracting the number of marbles Doug has now from the number of marbles Ed has will give us the difference in their marble counts.

Let's solve the equation:

x + 10 = 45
Subtracting 10 from both sides:
x = 35

Now let's find the difference in their marble counts:

Ed's marble count: x + 10 = 35 + 10 = 45
Doug's marble count: x - 11 = 35 - 11 = 24

The difference in their marble counts is:

ed had 5 more marbles than doug . doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 27 marbles how many marbles did doug have initially ?,"Let's assume that Doug initially had ""x"" marbles.

According to the given information, Ed had 5 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed had ""x + 5"" marbles.

It is also mentioned that Doug lost 3 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, after losing 3 marbles, Doug would have had ""x - 3"" marbles.

Given that Ed had 27 marbles, we can set up the equation:

x + 5 = <<x + 5 = 27>> 27

To find the initial number of marbles Doug had, we need to solve for ""x"" in the equation above.

Subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 27 - 5>> 27 - 5

Simplifying:

x = <<x = 22>> 22

Therefore, initially Doug had 22 marbles.

After losing some marbles at the playground, Ed now has 8 more marbles than Doug. This means that Ed currently has <<x + 8>> marbles.

To find out how many marbles Ed lost, we need to calculate the difference between the initial number of marbles Ed had and the current number of marbles he has. 

The initial number of marbles Ed had was <<x + 19>>, and the current number of marbles he has is <<x + 8>>. Therefore, the number of marbles Ed lost can be calculated as:

ed had 30 more marbles than doug . ed lost 21 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 91 marbles how many more marbles did ed have than doug then ?,"Let's assume that Doug has ""x"" number of marbles. According to the given information, Ed had 30 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed would have ""x + 30"" marbles.

Next, it is mentioned that Ed lost 21 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, the new number of marbles Ed has is ""x + 30 - 21"".

According to the question, we know that Ed had 91 marbles. So we can set up the equation:

x + 30 - 21 = <<x + 30 - 21 = 91>> 91

Simplifying this equation step by step:

x + 9 = <<x + 9 = 91>> 91

Subtracting 9 from both sides:

x = <<x = 82>> 82

Therefore, Doug has 82 marbles.

To find out how many more marbles Ed has than Doug, we subtract Doug's number of marbles from Ed's:

(x + 30) - x = <<(x + 30) - x = (82 + 30) - 82>> (82 + 30) - 82

Simplifying this expression:

112 - 82 = <<112 - 82 = ####>> ####

ed had 12 more marbles than doug . ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground . if ed had 17 marbles how many marbles does doug have now ?,"Let's assume that Doug has ""x"" marbles.

According to the given information, Ed had 12 more marbles than Doug. So, Ed would have ""x + 12"" marbles.

Then, it is mentioned that Ed lost 20 of his marbles at the playground. Therefore, Ed would have ""x + 12 - 20"" marbles remaining, which is equal to 17.

To find out how many marbles Doug has now, we need to equate the expression for Ed's remaining marbles to 17 and solve for ""x"".

x + 12 - 20 = <<x + 12 - 20 = 17>> 17

Simplifying the equation:

x - 8 = <<x - 8 = 17>> 17

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 25>> 25

Therefore, Doug has 25 marbles now.

Given:
Total number of choices = 66
Number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes = 450
Number of students who suggested adding bacon = 38

To find the number of students who participated in suggesting new food items, we can subtract the number of students who suggested mashed potatoes and bacon from the total number of students:

Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon = Number of students who participated in suggesting new food items

Let's calculate it step by step:

Total number of students = Total number of choices
Total number of students = 66

Number of students who participated in suggesting new food items = Total number of students - Number of students who suggested mashed potatoes - Number of students who suggested bacon
Number of students who participated in suggesting new food items = 66 - 450 - 38

Now let's calculate the result:

According to the given information, we know that 218 students suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon (x) and 351 students suggested adding only bacon (y).

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we need to add the number of students who suggested adding mashed potatoes as well as bacon (x) and the number of students who suggested adding only bacon (y).

Therefore, the total number of students who suggested adding bacon is x + y.

From the given information, we have:
x = 218
y = 351

To find the total number of students who suggested adding bacon, we substitute the values of x and y into the equation:

Total number of students who suggested adding bacon = x + y
Total number of students who suggested adding bacon = 218 + 351

Calculating this expression gives us:

Total number of students who suggested adding bacon = 569

According to the given information, there are 868 girls in the school. We also know that there are 281 more girls than boys. 

So, we can set up an equation to represent this situation: 

 868 = << 868 = b + 281 >> b + 281 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together. 

 tTotal number of pupils = << tTotal number of pupils = tNumber of girls + tNumber of boys >> tNumber of girls + tNumber of boys 

Substituting the value of girls (868) into the equation:

 tTotal number of pupils = << tTotal number of pupils = 868 + b >> 868 + b 

Now, let's solve for << b >> in the first equation:

 868 = << 868 = b + 281 >> b + 281 

Subtracting 281 from both sides:

 868 - 281 = << 868 - 281 = b >> b 

 b = << b = 587 >> 587 

Now, substituting this value back into the equation for the total number of pupils:

 tTotal number of pupils = << tTotal number of pupils = 868 + 587 >> 868 + 587

2. The rest of the students are boys.
3. We also know that there are 142 more boys than girls.

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of girls and boys together.

Let's calculate the number of boys:
- If there are 142 more boys than girls, we can represent this as <<700 + 142>>.

Now, let's calculate the total number of pupils:
- To find the total number of pupils, we add the number of girls and boys: <<700 + (700 + 142)>>.

Simplifying this expression:
- 700 + (700 + 142) = <<700 + (700 + 142) = 700 + 700 + 142>> 700 + 700 + 142.

Calculating further:
- 700 + 700 + 142 = <<700 + 700 + 142 = 1400 + 142>> 1400 + 142.

Continuing to simplify:

 tTotal pupils = << tTotal pupils = 706 + 222 >> 706 + 222 

 tTotal pupils = << tTotal pupils = 928 >> 928 

Now, we are told that 418 more girls joined the school. To find the new total number of pupils, we need to add this number to the previous total:

 tNew total pupils = << tNew total pupils = tTotal pupils + tNumber of additional girls >> tTotal pupils + tNumber of additional girls 

 tNew total pupils = << tNew total pupils = 928 + 418 >> 928 + 418

 b + 402 = << b + 402 = 739 >> 739 

To find the value of << b >>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 402 from both sides:

 b + 402 - 402 = << b + 402 - 402 = 739 - 402 >> 739 - 402 

Simplifying,

 b + 458 = << b + 458 = 692 >> 692 

To find the total number of pupils in the school, we need to add the number of boys and girls together. 

 b + (b + 458) = << b + (b + 458) = b + b + 458 = 2b + 458 >> b + b + 458 = 2b + 458 

Now we can solve for << b >> by subtracting 458 from both sides of the equation: 

 (2b + 458) - 458 = << (2b + 458) - 458 = 692 - 458 >> 692 - 458 

Simplifying, we have:

According to the problem, Edward now has 3 units of money. So we can set up the equation:

13 - x = 3

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 13 from both sides:

- x = 3 - 13

Initial amount - 9 = Remaining amount after first expenditure

Next, it is mentioned that Edward spent 8 more units of money. So, if we subtract another 8 from the remaining amount after the first expenditure, we will get the final amount of money Edward has now.

Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8 = Final amount

According to the problem, the final amount is 17 units of money. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8 = 17

To find the initial amount Edward had before spending his money, we need to solve this equation for the remaining amount after the first expenditure.

Let's add 8 to both sides of the equation:

(Remaining amount after first expenditure - 8) + 8 = 17 + 8

Simplifying,

Remaining amount after first expenditure = 25

So, each book costs >>2 / 11}<<.

Now, we know that Edward currently has 6 books. To find out how much money he had before spending it, we need to calculate the total cost of those 6 books.

The total cost can be found by multiplying the cost per book (>>2 / 11}<<) by the number of books (6):

3. The mouse jumped 26 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to calculate the total distance covered by the frog and then subtract 26 inches from it.

The frog jumped 32 inches farther than the grasshopper, so we can represent the distance covered by the frog as <<25 + 32>>.

Now, to find out how far the mouse jumped, we need to subtract 26 inches from the distance covered by the frog: <<(25 + 32) - 26>>.

Calculating this expression step by step:
(25 + 32) - 26 = <<(25 + 32) - 26 = 57 - 26 = 31>> 57 - 26 = 31

1. The grasshopper jumped 21 inches.
2. The grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog.
3. The mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse, we need to determine the distances jumped by both the frog and the mouse.

Let's represent the distance jumped by the frog as ""x"" inches. According to the second statement, the grasshopper jumped 25 inches farther than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x + 25"" inches.

According to the third statement, the mouse jumped 16 inches lesser than the frog, so its distance can be represented as ""x - 16"" inches.

Now we can calculate how much farther the grasshopper jumped than the mouse by subtracting their distances:

Distance jumped by grasshopper - Distance jumped by mouse
= (x + 25) - (x - 16)

Simplifying this expression:

= x + 25 - x + 16
= x - x + 25 + 16

 tCups of flour needed - tCups of salt needed = << tCups of flour needed - tCups of salt needed = tCups of flour to add now >> tCups of flour to add now 

 12 - 7 = << 12 - 7 = tCups of flour to add now >> tCups of flour to add now 

Simplifying the calculation:

 12 - 7 = << 12 - 7 = 5 >> 5 

Therefore, Mary needs to add 5 more cups of flour than cups of salt.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar and 10 cups of flour . she already put in some cups of flour . if she still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar how many cups of flour did she put in ?,"Let's assume the number of cups of flour Mary put in is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the problem, Mary still needs 5 more cups of flour than sugar. Since the recipe calls for 3 cups of sugar, Mary needs 3 + 5 = <<3 + 5 = 8>> 8 cups of flour in total.

We also know that Mary already put in some cups of flour, which is represented by <<x>>. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

x + 5 = <<x + 5 = 8>> 8

To solve for <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:

x = <<x = 8 - 5>> 8 - 5

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

Therefore, Mary put in 3 cups of flour.

winter is almost here and most animals are migrating to warmer countries . there are 18 bird families living near the mountain . if 38 bird families flew away to africa and 80 bird families flew away to asia how many bird families flew away for the winter ?,"To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we need to add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia.

Given:
Number of bird families living near the mountain = 18
Number of bird families that flew to Africa = 38
Number of bird families that flew to Asia = 80

To find the total number of bird families that flew away for the winter, we add the number of bird families that flew to Africa and the number of bird families that flew to Asia:

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = Number of bird families that flew to Africa + Number of bird families that flew to Asia

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = 38 + 80

Calculating this sum, we get:

Total number of bird families that flew away for the winter = 118

paul got a box of 521 crayons and 66 erasers for his birthday . at the end of the school year he only had 154 left while not having lost a single erasers . how many crayons had been lost or given away ?,"To find out how many crayons had been lost or given away, we need to subtract the number of crayons Paul had left at the end of the school year from the total number of crayons he received for his birthday.

Total number of crayons received = 521
Number of crayons left at the end of the school year = 154

To find the number of crayons lost or given away, we subtract the number of crayons left from the total number received:

521 - 154 = ####

Calculating this subtraction, we find that Paul had lost or given away #### crayons.

paul got a box of some crayons for his birthday . by the end of the school year he only had 291 left since he had either lost or given away 315 of them . how many crayons did he get for his birthday ?,"Let's assume that Paul initially had x crayons. According to the problem, he lost or gave away 315 crayons by the end of the school year. Therefore, the number of crayons he had left can be represented as x - 315.

We also know that by the end of the school year, Paul had 291 crayons left. So we can set up the equation:

x - 315 = 291

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 315 to both sides:

x - 315 + 315 = 291 + 315
x = 606

Therefore, Paul initially had 606 crayons for his birthday.

a waiter had 3 customers . after some left he still had 4 customers . how many more customers stayed behind than those that left ?,"Let's denote the number of customers who left as ""x"". 

Initially, the waiter had 3 customers. After some left, he still had 4 customers. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

3 - x = 4

To find out how many more customers stayed behind than those that left, we need to solve for ""x"". 

Adding ""x"" to both sides of the equation: 

3 - x + x = 4 + x

Simplifying the equation: 

3 = 4 + x

Subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation: 

3 - 4 = 4 + x - 4

-1 = x

Therefore, there is 1 more customer who stayed behind than those that left.

dan has 2 . he bought some candy bar for 6 each one costing 3 . how many candy bar did he buy ?,"To find out how many candy bars Dan bought, we can divide the total amount he spent on candy bars by the cost of each candy bar.

Dan spent a total of <<6 for each candy bar, and he bought some candy bars. Let's represent the number of candy bars he bought as ""x"".

The total amount Dan spent on candy bars is given by multiplying the cost of each candy bar (>>6) by the number of candy bars he bought (x):

Total amount = <<6 * x

We also know that each candy bar costs >>3. So, we can set up an equation:

<<6 * x = Total amount
>>3 * x = Total amount

Since both equations represent the same thing, we can equate them:

6 * x = <<6 * x = >> 3 * x

To solve for x, we can divide both sides of the equation by <<3:

(>>6 * x) / 3 = <<3 = (>> (3 * x) / $3
2x = x

Now, we have found that 2x = x. This means that Dan bought 2 candy bars.

We can represent this situation with the equation: x - 137 = 105.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Adding 137 to both sides of the equation, we get: x - 137 + 137 = 105 + 137.

Simplifying the equation, we have: x = 242.

Therefore, Paul had 242 books at the start.

paul had 108 books . after selling some books in a garage sale and giving 35 books to his friend he had 62 books left . how many books did he sell in the garage sale ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 108 books.
After selling some books in the garage sale, he had 108 - x books left.
He also gave 35 books to his friend, so he had (108 - x) - 35 = 62 books left.

To find the value of x, we can set up an equation:
(108 - x) - 35 = 62

Simplifying the equation:
108 - x - 35 = 62
73 - x = 62

To isolate x, we subtract 73 from both sides of the equation:
73 - x - 73 = 62 - 73
-x = -11

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-11)
x = 11

Therefore, Paul sold 11 books in the garage sale.

paul had 50 books . after buying some in a garage sale he had 151 left . how many books did he buy ?,"Let's assume that Paul bought x books in the garage sale. 

Initially, Paul had 50 books. After buying x books in the garage sale, he had 151 left. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

50 - x = 151 

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 50 from both sides of the equation: 

50 - x - 50 = 151 - 50 

Simplifying: 

-x = 101 

To solve for x, we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to get rid of the negative sign: 

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(101) 

Simplifying: 

x = -101 

However, since we are dealing with a number of books, it doesn't make sense for x to be negative. Therefore, there must be an error in the problem statement or our calculations.

paul had 71 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought 38 new ones . if he has 116 books now how many more books did he buy than he sold ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale. 

Before the garage sale, Paul had 71 books. After selling some, he bought 38 new ones. So, the total number of books he had after the garage sale is given by:

71 - x + 38

We are told that he now has 116 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

71 - x + 38 = 116

To find out how many more books Paul bought than he sold, we need to solve for x.

Combining like terms on the left side of the equation:

109 - x = 116

Subtracting 109 from both sides of the equation:

-x = 7

Multiplying both sides by -1 to isolate x:

x = -7

Since we cannot have a negative number of books sold, it means that Paul must have bought more books than he sold. To find out how many more books he bought, we take the absolute value of x:

|-7| = 7

Therefore, Paul bought 7 more books than he sold.

2. He gave away 39 books to his friend.
3. After giving away the books, he had 134 - 39 = 95 books left.
4. He also sold some books in a garage sale.
5. After selling the books, he had 68 books left.

Initially, Paul had 95 pens and 153 books. After selling some books and pens, he had 13 books and 23 pens left.

So, we can set up two equations based on the given information:

1) Equation for books: 153 - x = 13
2) Equation for pens: 95 - y = 23

To find the number of books Paul sold, we need to solve equation (1) for x:

153 - x = 13
x = 153 - 13
x = 140

Therefore, Paul sold 140 books in the garage sale.

Initially, Paul had 42 pens and after selling some, he was left with 19 pens. So, the number of pens he sold can be calculated as:

42 - x = 19

To find the number of books Paul had initially, we subtract the number of books he has left from the total number of books he had initially:

143 - (113) = 30

Since we know that for every pen sold, one book was also sold, we can set up the following equation:

x = 30

Therefore, Paul sold 30 pens in the garage sale.

1. Initially, there were 2 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica threw away 4 roses from the vase.
3. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
4. After all these actions, there are now 23 roses in the vase.

To find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can subtract the initial number of roses and the number of roses she threw away from the total number of roses in the vase.

Initial number of roses = 2
Number of roses thrown away = 4
Total number of roses in the vase = 23

So, to find out how many roses Jessica cut, we can use the following equation:

 tTotal number of roses = << tTotal number of roses = tInitial number of roses + tNumber of roses cut - tNumber of roses thrown away >> tInitial number of roses + tNumber of roses cut - tNumber of roses thrown away 

Substituting the given values:

 23 = << 23 = 2 + tNumber of roses cut - 4 >> 2 + tNumber of roses cut - 4 

Now, let's solve for the unknown variable (Number of roses cut):

 23 = << 23 = 2 + tNumber of roses cut - 4 >> 2 + tNumber of roses cut - 4 

Combining like terms:

 23 = << 23 = -2 + tNumber of roses cut >> -2 + tNumber of roses cut 

Adding 2 to both sides:

 25 = << 25 = tNumber of roses cut >> tNumber of roses cut 

Therefore, Jessica cut a total of ######25###### roses from her flower garden.

1. Initially, there were 15 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica threw away 33 roses from the vase.
3. After throwing away the roses, there were 15 - 33 = -18 roses in the vase. (Negative number indicates that there are no roses left in the vase)
4. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
5. After adding the new roses, there are now 17 roses in the vase.
6. To find out how many more roses Jessica cut than those she threw away, we need to calculate the difference between the number of new roses and the number of roses thrown away.
7. Let's represent the number of new roses Jessica cut as ""x"".
8. The equation representing the situation is: -18 + x = 17.
9. Solving this equation for ""x"", we can add 18 to both sides: x = 17 + 18 = 35.

Initially, there were 15 roses and 62 orchids in the vase. After Jessica cut some more flowers, there are now 17 roses and 96 orchids in the vase.

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 15 + x = <<15 + x = 17>> 17
Equation 2: 62 + y = <<62 + y = 96>> 96

Simplifying Equation 1, we find:
x = <<x = 17 - 15>> 17 - 15
x = <<x = 2>> 2

there were 16 roses and 3 orchids in the vase . jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden . there are now 7 orchids and 13 roses in the vase . how many orchids did she cut ?,"Let's assume that Jessica cut <<x>> orchids from her flower garden. 

Initially, there were 3 orchids in the vase, and after cutting some more, there are now 7 orchids in the vase. Therefore, the number of orchids Jessica cut can be calculated as:

3 + x = <<3 + x = 7>> 7

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

3 + x - 3 = <<3 + x - 3 = 7 - 3>> 7 - 3

Simplifying the equation gives us:

x = <<x = 4>> 4

So, Jessica cut 4 orchids from her flower garden.

Now let's consider the roses. Initially, there were 16 roses in the vase, and after cutting some more, there are now 13 roses in the vase. Therefore, the number of roses Jessica cut can be calculated as:

16 - x = <<16 - x = 13>> 13

To find the value of <<x>>, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:

16 - x - 16 = <<16 - x - 16 = 13 - 16>> 13 - 16

Simplifying the equation gives us:

-x = <<-x = -3>> -3

To solve for <<x>>, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

-1  (-x) = <<-1  (-x) = -1  (-3)>> -1  (-3)

This simplifies to:

x = <<x = 3>> 3

So, Jessica cut 3 roses from her flower garden.

We are given that there were 9 roses and 6 orchids in the vase.

Next, we are told that Jessica cut some more roses and orchids from her flower garden. Let's assume she cut r roses and o orchids.

After cutting these flowers, the total number of roses in the vase becomes 9 + r, and the total number of orchids becomes 6 + o.

Finally, we are given that there are now 13 orchids and 3 roses in the vase. So we can set up the following equations:

9 + r = 3   (equation 1)
6 + o = 13  (equation 2)

To find how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now, we need to subtract the number of roses from the number of orchids. Let's solve for r and o using equations 1 and 2.

From equation 1:
r = 3 - 9
r = -6

From equation 2:
o = 13 - 6
o = 7

Now we can calculate how many more orchids than roses there are in the vase now by subtracting the number of roses from the number of orchids:

at the arcade dave had won 7 tickets . he used some tickets to buy toys . if he still has 2 tickets left how many tickets did dave use to buy toys ?,"Let's assume that Dave used <<x>> tickets to buy toys. 

According to the given information, Dave initially had 7 tickets and he used some of them to buy toys. This can be represented as <<7 - x>>, where <<x>> is the number of tickets he used.

We are also told that Dave still has 2 tickets left. So, we can set up the equation:

7 - x = <<7 - x = 2>> 2

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to solve this equation for <<x>>. 

Adding <<x>> to both sides of the equation:

7 - x + x = <<7 - x + x = 2 + x>> 2 + x

Simplifying:

7 = <<7 = 2 + x>> 2 + x

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:

7 - 2 = <<7 - 2 = 2 + x - 2>> 2 + x - 2

Simplifying:

5 = <<5 = x>> x

Therefore, Dave used 5 tickets to buy toys.

First, let's calculate the total number of sacks harvested in 51 days. Since they harvest 74 sacks per day, we can multiply this by the number of days:

 74 * 51 = << 74 * 51 = 3774 >> 3774 

So, they will have harvested a total of 3774 sacks in 51 days.

Next, let's calculate the total number of sacks discarded in 51 days. Since they discard 71 sacks per day, we can multiply this by the number of days:

 71 * 51 = << 71 * 51 = 3621 >> 3621 

So, they will have discarded a total of 3621 sacks in 51 days.

Finally, to find out how many sacks of oranges they will have after 51 days of harvest, we need to subtract the number of discarded sacks from the total harvested:

 3774 - 3621 = << 3774 - 3621 = #### >> ####

paige was helping her mom plant flowers and together they planted 55 seeds . they put 15 seeds in each flower bed and only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed . how many flowers did they grow ?,"To find the total number of flowers they grew, we need to determine the number of flower beds and then multiply it by the number of flowers that grew in each bed.

First, let's find the number of flower beds. We know that they planted a total of 55 seeds and put 15 seeds in each flower bed. To find the number of flower beds, we can divide the total number of seeds by the number of seeds per bed:

 tNumber of flower beds = << tNumber of flower beds = 5 / 515 >> 5 / 515 

Now, let's find out how many flowers grew in each flower bed. We are given that only 60 seeds grew into flowers in each flower bed.

Finally, we can calculate the total number of flowers by multiplying the number of flower beds by the number of flowers that grew in each bed:

 tTotal number of flowers = << tTotal number of flowers = tNumber of flower beds * tNumber of flowers that grew in each bed >> tNumber of flower beds * tNumber of flowers that grew in each bed 

Let's calculate it step by step:

 tNumber of flower beds = << tNumber of flower beds = 5 / 515 = 3.6667 >> 5 / 515 = 3.6667  (rounded to four decimal places)

Since we cannot have a fraction or decimal value for the number of flower beds, we will round it down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there were 3 flower beds.

 tTotal number of flowers = << tTotal number of flowers = 3 * 60 = 180 >> 3 * 60 = 180 

Therefore, Paige and her mom grew a total of 180 flowers.

First, let's calculate the total number of students who want to go on the trip. We know that there are 102 students in the school and 22 students do not want to go. So, the number of students who want to go is:

102 - 22 = <<102 - 22 = 80>> 80

Next, we need to determine how many buses are needed to accommodate these 80 students. Since each bus has 8 seats, we can divide the total number of students by the number of seats per bus:

80 / 8 = <<80 / 8 = 10>> 10

Therefore, 10 buses are needed to take the field trip.

a mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block . if the mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block . how many houses are there in a block ?,"To find the number of houses in a block, we can use the given information that the mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block and has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block.

Let's assume there are ""x"" houses in a block.

The mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house, so the total number of junk mails given to all houses in a block is 14 * x.

The mailman has to give 2 pieces of junk mail to each block, so the total number of junk mails given to all blocks is 2 * (number of blocks).

Since each block contains ""x"" houses, the total number of blocks is equal to the total number of houses divided by ""x"".

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

14 * x = 2 * (total number of houses / x)

To solve for ""x"", we can cross multiply:

14 * x * x = 2 * total number of houses

Simplifying further:

14x^2 = 2 * total number of houses

Dividing both sides by 2:

7x^2 = total number of houses

Now, let's consider the given information that the mailman gives 14 junk mails to each house in a block. This implies that there are at least some houses in a block. Therefore, the total number of houses must be greater than or equal to 14.

Let's substitute some values for the total number of houses and see if it satisfies our equation:

If we assume there are 14 houses in a block, then:

7(14)^2 = 14
7(196) = 14
1372 = 14

This is not true since 1372 does not equal 14.

If we assume there are 28 houses in a block, then:

7(784) = 28
5488 = 28

This is also not true since 5488 does not equal 28.

If we assume there are 42 houses in a block, then:

7(42)^2 = 42
7(1764) = 42
12348 = 42

This is not true since 12348 does not equal 42.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail. The mailman has to give 30 pieces of junk mail to each of the 78 blocks. So, we can multiply these two numbers together:

 30 * 78 = << 30 * 78 = 2340 >> 2340 

Therefore, the mailman has a total of 2340 pieces of junk mail.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of houses. We are given that there are 19 houses on each block, and there are 78 blocks in total. So, we can multiply these two numbers together:

Let's represent the number of points Luke scored per round as ""x"".

In the first round, Luke scored ""x"" points.
In the second round, Luke also scored ""x"" points.

Therefore, the total number of points Luke scored can be expressed as:
Total points = Points in first round + Points in second round
Total points = x + x

Since we know that the total number of points Luke scored is 84, we can write the equation:
2x = 84

To solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
2x/2 = 84/2
x = 42

Hence, Luke scored 42 points per round.

adam has 3 more apples than jackie . adam has 9 apples . how many apples does jackie have ?,"Let's solve the problem step by step:

1. We are given that Adam has 3 more apples than Jackie.
2. We are also given that Adam has 9 apples.
3. To find out how many apples Jackie has, we need to subtract 3 from the number of apples Adam has.

Calculations:
- Adam's apples = 9
- Jackie's apples = Adam's apples - 3

Substituting the value of Adam's apples into the equation:
- Jackie's apples = 9 - 3

Simplifying the calculation:
- Jackie's apples = 6

together adam and jackie have 12 apples . has 9 apples more than adam and jackie together do . adam has 8 more apples than jackie . how many apples does have ?,"Let's assume the number of apples Jackie has as ""x"". According to the given information, Adam has 8 more apples than Jackie, so Adam would have ""x + 8"" apples.

Together, Adam and Jackie have 12 apples, so we can write the equation:

(x) + (x + 8) = 12

Simplifying the equation:

2x + 8 = 12

Subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 4

Dividing both sides by 2:

x = 2

So, Jackie has 2 apples.

Now, to find out how many apples Adam has, we can substitute the value of x into the expression ""x + 8"":

2 + 8 = ####

Therefore, Adam has 10 apples.

1. ""Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie.""
2. ""Jackie has 10 apples.""
3. ""Together Adam and Jackie have 2 apples.""
4. ""Has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do.""

Let's assign variables to the unknown quantities:
- Let A represent the number of apples Adam has.
- Let J represent the number of apples Jackie has.

From the given information, we can form equations:

1. ""Adam has 4 more apples than Jackie."" can be written as A = J + 4.
2. ""Jackie has 10 apples."" can be written as J = 10.
3. ""Together Adam and Jackie have 2 apples."" can be written as A + J = 2.
4. ""Has 6 apples more than Adam and Jackie together do."" can be written as (A + J) + 6.

Now, let's substitute the known values into these equations:

From equation (2), we know that J = 10.
Substituting this value into equation (1), we get A = 10 + 4 = 14.

From equation (3), we know that A + J = 2.
Substituting the values of A and J, we get 14 + J = 2.
Simplifying this equation, we find J = -12.

However, since it doesn't make sense for someone to have a negative number of apples, there must be an error in the given information or equations provided. Please double-check the problem statement or provide additional information to resolve this discrepancy.

for the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 10 small planks . if large planks together need 15 pieces of nails to be secured and small planks together need 5 nails . how many nails does john need for the house wall ?,"To find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall, we need to calculate the number of nails required for the large planks and the small planks separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks. We know that each large plank requires 15 nails to be secured, and John is using 12 large planks. So, we can multiply these two numbers to find the total number of nails needed for the large planks:

 15 * 12 = << 15 * 12 = 180 >> 180 

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks. We are given that each small plank requires 5 nails to be secured, and John is using 10 small planks. So, we can multiply these two numbers to find the total number of nails needed for the small planks:

 5 * 10 = << 5 * 10 = 50 >> 50 

Finally, we can add the number of nails needed for the large planks and the small planks together to find the total number of nails John needs for the house wall:

 180 + 50 = << 180 + 50 = 230 >> 230 

Therefore, John needs a total of 230 nails for the house wall.

for the walls of the house he would use 8 large planks of wood . if each plank of wood needs 74 pieces of nails to be secured how many planks does john need for the house wall ?,"To find the number of planks John needs for the house wall, we need to divide the total number of nails required by the number of nails needed per plank.

Given that each plank needs 74 pieces of nails, and John needs 8 planks, we can calculate the total number of nails required as follows:

Total number of nails = Number of nails per plank * Number of planks
Total number of nails = 74 * 8

Calculating this expression, we find:

Total number of nails = 592

Therefore, John needs 592 nails for the house wall. To determine the number of planks he needs, we divide this total by the number of nails needed per plank:

Number of planks = Total number of nails / Number of nails per plank
Number of planks = 592 / 74

Calculating this expression, we find:

Number of planks = 8

Hence, John needs 8 planks for the house wall.

julia played tag with some kids on monday . she played tag with 14 kids on tuesday . if she played with a total of 16 kids how many kids did she play with on monday ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Julia played tag with some kids on Monday, and she played tag with 14 kids on Tuesday. If she played with a total of 16 kids, we need to find out how many kids she played with on Monday.

To solve this, we can set up an equation:

 tNumber of kids Julia played with on Monday + tNumber of kids Julia played with on Tuesday = << tNumber of kids Julia played with on Monday + tNumber of kids Julia played with on Tuesday = tTotal number of kids >> tTotal number of kids 

Let's substitute the values we know:

 tNumber of kids on Monday + 14 = << tNumber of kids on Monday + 14 = 16 >> 16 

Now, we need to isolate the number of kids on Monday. We can do that by subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation:

 tNumber of kids on Monday = << tNumber of kids on Monday = 16 - 14 >> 16 - 14 

Now, we can calculate:

 tNumber of kids on Monday = << tNumber of kids on Monday = 2 >> 2

julia played tag with 19 kids on monday . she played tag with 18 kids on tuesday . she spent a total of 38 hours to play tag on both days . how many more kids did she play with on monday than on tuesday ?,"To solve this problem, we need to first set up equations based on the information given in the problem. Let's denote the number of hours Julia spent playing tag with 19 kids on Monday as \( x \) hours, and the number of hours she spent playing tag with 18 kids on Tuesday as \( y \) hours. We know that the total time she spent playing tag on both days is 38 hours. So, we can write the following equation:

\[ x + y = 38  t(1) \]

We also know that she played tag with 19 kids on Monday and 18 kids on Tuesday. We need to find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday. Let's denote this difference as \( z \). We can write another equation based on the number of kids she played with:

\[ 19 - 18 = z  t(2) \]

Now, we can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \).

From equation (1), we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 38 - x \]

Substituting this into equation (2), we can solve for \( z \):

\[ 19 - 18 = 38 - x \]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[ x = 21 \]

Now that we know the value of \( x \), we can find the value of \( y \) using equation (1):

\[ y = 38 - x = 38 - 21 = 17 \]

Finally, we can find the difference in the number of kids she played with on Monday and Tuesday (\( z \)):

\[ z = 19 - 18 = 1 \]

bobby had 22 pieces of candy . he ate some pieces of candy . then he ate 5 more . if he still has 8 pieces of candy left how many pieces of candy had he eaten at the start ?,"Let's assume that Bobby had eaten x pieces of candy at the start.

After eating some pieces of candy, he had 22 - x pieces of candy left.

Then he ate 5 more pieces of candy, so he had 22 - x - 5 = 17 - x pieces of candy left.

If he still has 8 pieces of candy left, we can set up the equation:

17 - x = 8

To solve for x, we can subtract 17 from both sides of the equation:

17 - x - 17 = 8 - 17

-x = -9

To isolate x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-9)

x = 9

Therefore, Bobby had eaten 9 pieces of candy at the start.

According to the information given, Jake brought 4 more balloons than Allan. So, the number of balloons Jake brought can be represented as <<x + 4>>. 

We also know that Jake brought a total of 6 balloons. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: 

x + 4 = <<x + 4 = 6>> 6

To solve for <<x>>, we can subtract 4 from both sides of the equation: 

x = <<x = 6 - 4>> 6 - 4

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us: 

x = <<x = 2>> 2

So, Allan brought 2 balloons to the park.

According to the given information, he spends 3 hours on learning English. So, the total time he spends on learning English and Chinese is <<3 + x>> hours. 

We are also given that the total time he spends on learning English and Chinese every day is 4 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

3 + x = <<3 + x = 4>> 4

To solve for <<x>>, we can subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

x = <<x = 4 - 3>> 4 - 3

Simplifying the right side gives us:

x = <<x = 1>> 1

Therefore, Ryan spends 1 hour on learning Chinese every day.

To find out how many hours he spends on learning English and Chinese each day over 86 days, we can first calculate the total hours he spends on each subject during this period and then divide it by the number of days.

For English:
\[ tTotal hours spent on English = 4 \, thours/day * 86 \, tdays = 344 \, thours \]

For Chinese:
\[ tTotal hours spent on Chinese = 6 \, thours/day * 86 \, tdays = 516 \, thours \]

Now, to find the number of hours he spends on learning English and Chinese each day, we divide these totals by the number of days (86 days):

For English:
\[ tHours spent on English each day = 3 / 44 \, thours}86 \, t{days} = 4 \, thours/day \]

For Chinese:
\[ tHours spent on Chinese each day = 5 / 16 \, thours}86 \, t{days} = 6 \, thours/day \]

2. He added 4 more action figures.
3. He then removed 5 old action figures.

To find out how many action figures were on his shelf in all, we need to perform these three actions:

Step 1: Jerry had 8 action figures.
Step 2: He added 4 more action figures, which means we add 4 to the initial 8.
Step 3: He removed 5 old action figures, which means we subtract 5 from the result of step 2.

Now, let's calculate it step by step:

We want to find out how many action figures he added to the shelf.

Starting with what we know:

Jerry initially had 7 action figures, and then he added some more. After that, he removed 10 of the old ones. So, the total number of action figures on the shelf after adding some and removing 10 old ones is:

<<7 + tadded - 10>>

And we know that this total is now 8. So, we can write the equation:

7 + tadded - 10 = <<7 + tadded - 10 = 8>> 8

To find the number of action figures he added, we can rearrange the equation:

tadded = <<tadded = 8 - 7 + 10>> 8 - 7 + 10

Now, let's calculate this:

tadded = <<tadded = 8 - 7 + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11>> 8 - 7 + 10 = 1 + 10 = 11

We need to find out how many action figures Jerry had initially.

Let's use algebraic reasoning with << symbols to represent the initial number of action figures.

Jerry's initial number of action figures + 2 (added) - 7 (removed) = 10 (current total)

So, we can express this as an equation:

>> Initial + 2 - 7 = 10 <<

Now, let's solve for Initial.

>> Initial - 5 = 10 <<

To isolate Initial, add 5 to both sides of the equation.

>> Initial = 10 + 5 <<

Now, calculate the value of Initial.

>> Initial = 15 $

So, Jerry initially had 15 action figures on his shelf.

jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on a shelf in his room . later he added 2 more action figures to the shelf . how many more action figures than books were on his shelf ?," Here is a step-by-step solution to the math problem:

Jerry had 3 books and 4 action figures on the shelf. That means he had <<3>> books and <<4>> action figures initially.
Then he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. So now he has 4 + 2 = <<4 + 2 = 6>> 6 action figures total.
He still has <<3>> books.
The question asks how many more action figures than books he has on the shelf.
To calculate that, we subtract the number of books from the number of action figures:
6 - 3 = <<6 - 3 = 3>> 3

Later, he added 2 more action figures to the shelf. To find out how many more books than action figures were on his shelf, we need to subtract the number of action figures from the number of books.

Number of books: 7
Number of action figures: 3
Number of additional action figures: 2

To find the difference between the number of books and action figures, we subtract the number of action figures from the number of books:

7 - 3 = <<7 - 3 = 4>> 4

Therefore, there were 4 more books than action figures on Jerry's shelf.

a book has 2 chapters across 23 pages . the first chapter is 10 pages long . how many pages are in the first chapter ?,"To find the number of pages in the first chapter, we need to subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages in the book.

Given that there are 2 chapters across 23 pages, we can divide the total number of pages by the number of chapters to find the average number of pages per chapter. 

 tAverage number of pages per chapter = << tAverage number of pages per chapter = 2 / 32 = 11.5 >> 2 / 32 = 11.5 

Since we know that the first chapter is 10 pages long, we can subtract this value from the average to find the number of pages in the second chapter.

 tNumber of pages in second chapter = << tNumber of pages in second chapter = tAverage number of pages per chapter - tNumber of pages in first chapter = 11.5 - 10 = 1.5 >> tAverage number of pages per chapter - tNumber of pages in first chapter = 11.5 - 10 = 1.5 

Therefore, there are 1.5 pages in the second chapter.

To find the number of pages in the first chapter, we can subtract the number of pages in the second chapter from the total number of pages.

 tNumber of pages in first chapter = << tNumber of pages in first chapter = tTotal number of pages - tNumber of pages in second chapter = 23 - 1.5 = 21.5 >> tTotal number of pages - tNumber of pages in second chapter = 23 - 1.5 = 21.5 

However, since a book cannot have a fraction of a page, we round down to get a whole number.

 tNumber of pages in first chapter (rounded down) = << tNumber of pages in first chapter (rounded down) =  21.5  = 21 >>  21.5  = 21

15 campers went rowing in the morning . some more campers went rowing in the afternoon . if a total of 32 campers went rowing that day how many campers went rowing in the afternoon ?,"Sure, let's solve the problem step by step.

In the morning, 15 campers went rowing. Let's denote the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon as \( x \). According to the given information, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 32.

So, the total number of campers rowing is the sum of campers in the morning and afternoon:

\[ 15 + x = 32 \]

To find the value of \( x \), subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[ x = 32 - 15 \]

some campers went rowing in the morning while 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon . if a total of 60 campers went rowing that day how many campers went rowing in the morning ?,"Let's use algebra to solve this problem step by step. We can represent the number of campers who went rowing in the morning as ""M"" and the number of campers who went rowing in the afternoon as ""A.""

We are given two pieces of information:

1. Some campers went rowing in the morning.
2. 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon.

According to the problem, the total number of campers who went rowing that day is 60. So, we can write an equation based on this information:

M (campers in the morning) + A (campers in the afternoon) = 60

We also know that 7 campers went rowing in the afternoon:

A = 7

Now, we can substitute the value of A into the equation:

M + 7 = 60

Next, we want to solve for M (the number of campers who went rowing in the morning), so we need to isolate M on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation:

M + 7 - 7 = 60 - 7

M = 53

So, there were 53 campers who went rowing in the morning.

<<ed>> had <<2>> more marbles than <<doug>>. 

<<doug>> lost some of his marbles at the playground.

Now <<ed>> has <<19>> more marbles than <<doug>>.

Let's define variables:

e>> = <<e>> = number of marbles <<ed>> number of marbles <<ed has 
d>> = <<d>> = number of marbles <<doug>> number of marbles <<doug has 

According to the first sentence:

e = <<e = d + 2>> d + 2

Since <<ed>> now has <<19>> more marbles than <<doug>>:

e = <<e = d + 19>> d + 19

Equating the two equations:

d + 2 = <<d + 2 = d + 19>> d + 19
d = <<d = 17>> 17

Therefore, <<doug>> lost:

e - (d+19) = <<e - (d+19) = 37 - (17 + 19) = 1>> 37 - (17 + 19) = 1

   Let's assume Doug had \(D\) marbles.
   Ed had \(D + 24\) marbles.

2. **After Doug lost 27 marbles:**
   Doug has \(D - 27\) marbles.
   Ed still has \(D + 24\) marbles.

3. **After Ed found 9 more marbles:**
   Doug still has \(D - 27\) marbles.
   Ed has \((D + 24) + 9 = D + 33\) marbles.

4. **Difference in the number of marbles Ed had more than Doug:**
   Ed had \((D + 33) - (D - 27)\) marbles more than Doug.

rachel had to complete 9 pages of math homework 2 pages of reading homework and 96 more pages of biology homework . how many more pages of math homework than reading homework did she have ?,"To find out how many more pages of math homework Rachel had than reading homework, we need to subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework.

Given:
Math homework = 9 pages
Reading homework = 2 pages

To find the difference, we subtract the number of pages of reading homework from the number of pages of math homework:

9 - 2 = 7

Therefore, Rachel had 7 more pages of math homework than reading homework.

jack received 6 emails in the morning 3 emails in the afternoon and some more in the evening . if he received a total of 10 emails in the day how many emails did jack receive in the afternoon ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Jack received 6 emails in the morning and 3 emails in the afternoon. We can represent this with the following equation:

6 + 3 + temails in the evening = <<6 + 3 + temails in the evening = 10>> 10

Now, to find out how many emails Jack received in the evening, we can rearrange the equation as follows:

temails in the evening = <<temails in the evening = 10 - 6 - 3>> 10 - 6 - 3

Now, let's calculate the value on the right-hand side of the equation:

temails in the evening = <<temails in the evening = 10 - 6 - 3 = 1>> 10 - 6 - 3 = 1

So, Jack received 1 email in the evening. Now, to find out how many emails he received in the afternoon:

Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon.

jack received 3 emails in the afternoon 6 emails in the morning and some more in the evening . if he received a total of 10 emails in the day how many emails did jack receive in the afternoon ?,"Jack received 3 emails in the afternoon and 6 emails in the morning. Let's denote the number of emails he received in the evening as <<E>>.

The total number of emails Jack received in the day is the sum of the emails in the afternoon, morning, and evening:

3 (tafternoon) + 6 (tmorning) + E (tevening) = <<3 (tafternoon) + 6 (tmorning) + E (tevening) = 10 (ttotal)>> 10 (ttotal)

Now, we can solve for <<E>>:

3 + 6 + E = <<3 + 6 + E = 10>> 10

9 + E = <<9 + E = 10>> 10

E = <<E = 10 - 9>> 10 - 9

E = <<E = 1>> 1

So, Jack received 1 email in the evening.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches . the frog jumped 39 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 94 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the frog jump ?,"To find out how far the frog jumped, we need to add the distance the grasshopper jumped to the additional distance the frog jumped beyond the grasshopper's jump. Then, we subtract the distance the mouse jumped from the frog's total jump.

1. **Distance jumped by the frog beyond the grasshopper's jump:**
   Frog's jump - Grasshopper's jump = \( 39 \, tinches \)

2. **Total distance jumped by the frog:**
   Frog's jump = \( 19 \, tinches + 39 \, tinches = 58 \, tinches \)

3. **Distance jumped by the mouse lesser than the frog's jump:**
   Mouse's jump = \( 58 \, tinches - 94 \, tinches = -36 \, tinches \)

The frog jumped \( 58 \) inches.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 24 inches . the frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper and the mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog . how much farther did the mouse jump than the grasshopper ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem step by step:

1. The grasshopper jumped 24 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.
3. The mouse jumped 5 inches lesser than the frog.

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, we need to calculate the difference in the distances they jumped.

First, let's find out how far the frog jumped:

 Frog's\,Jump = << Frog's\,Jump = Grasshopper's\,Jump + 33 >> Grasshopper's\,Jump + 33 

 Frog's\,Jump = << Frog's\,Jump = 24 + 33 = 57\,inches >> 24 + 33 = 57\,inches 

Now, let's find out how far the mouse jumped:

 Mouse's\,Jump = << Mouse's\,Jump = Frog's\,Jump - 5 >> Frog's\,Jump - 5 

 Mouse's\,Jump = << Mouse's\,Jump = 57 - 5 = 52\,inches >> 57 - 5 = 52\,inches 

To find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper:

 Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = << Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = Mouse's\,Jump - Grasshopper's\,Jump >> Mouse's\,Jump - Grasshopper's\,Jump 

 Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = << Mouse's\,Jump\,Farther\,Than\,Grasshopper = 52 - 24 = 28\,inches >> 52 - 24 = 28\,inches 

So, the mouse jumped 28 inches farther than the grasshopper.

the grasshopper and the frog had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 13 inches . the grasshopper jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper . how far did the frog jump ?,"It seems there might be a typo in your question. You mentioned that the grasshopper jumped both 13 inches and 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, which doesn't make sense. I assume you meant to say the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and you want to find out how far the frog jumped.

If the grasshopper jumped 13 inches, and the frog jumped 2 inches farther than the grasshopper, we can calculate the distance the frog jumped by adding 13 inches (grasshopper's jump) to the 2 inches:

13 + 2 = <<13 + 2 = 15>> 15

So, the frog jumped 15 inches.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 39 inches . the grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog and the mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog . how far did the mouse jump ?,"Let's solve this step by step:

Let's denote the distance the frog jumped as <<F>>.

According to the information given:

- The grasshopper jumped 19 inches farther than the frog, which means the grasshopper's jump is <<F + 19>> inches.
- The mouse jumped 12 inches lesser than the frog, which means the mouse's jump is <<F - 12>> inches.

We know the grasshopper's jump is 39 inches. So we have the equation:

F + 19 = <<F + 19 = 39>> 39

Solving for <<F>>:

F = <<F = 39 - 19 = 20>> 39 - 19 = 20 inches.

Now, we can find the distance the mouse jumped using the value of <<F>>:

F - 12 = <<F - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8>> 20 - 12 = 8 inches.

Therefore, the mouse jumped 8 inches.

the grasshopper the frog and the mouse had a jumping contest . the grasshopper jumped 9 inches . the mouse jumped 3 inches lesser than the frog who jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper . how far did the mouse jump ?,"Let's break down the information provided:

1. The grasshopper jumped 9 inches.
2. The frog jumped 33 inches farther than the grasshopper.

Now, we need to find out how far the mouse jumped. We know that the mouse jumped 3 inches less than the frog. So, we can calculate the frog's jump first and then subtract 3 inches to find the mouse's jump.

Grasshopper's jump: <<9>> inches
Frog's jump: 33>> inches + Grasshopper's jump = <<33>> inches + Grasshopper's jump = <<33 + 9>> <<33 + 9 inches

Now, we need to find the mouse's jump, which is 3 inches less than the frog's jump:

Mouse's jump: Frog's jump - 3 inches

Mouse's jump: <<(33 + 9) - 3>> inches

Now, let's calculate:

Mouse's jump: <<33 + 9 - 3>>

Mouse's jump: <<39 - 3>>

Mouse's jump: <<36>> inches

So, the mouse jumped 36 inches.

Then, we can subtract the amount of sugar from the amount of flour to get the answer.

Here are the calculations:

1. Flour already put in: 5 cups
2. Sugar: 6 cups

Now, let's find the difference between the amount of flour and sugar:

5 - 6 = <<5 - 6 = -1>> -1

The result is -1, which means Mary has already put in 1 cup less flour than sugar. To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add, we can take the absolute value of -1, which is 1.

So, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

Then, we can calculate the difference between the cups of sugar and flour.

1. Mary already put in 4 cups of flour.
2. The recipe calls for 9 cups of flour, so she needs to add 9 - 4 = 5 more cups of flour.
3. The recipe calls for 11 cups of sugar.
4. To find out how many more cups of sugar than flour she needs to add, we subtract the number of cups of flour from the number of cups of sugar: 11 - 4 = 7 cups.

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar . she already put in some cups of flour . if she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar how many more cups of flour does she need to add ?,"Let's break down the information provided in the problem step by step.

1. The recipe calls for 6 cups of flour and 13 cups of sugar.
2. Mary has already added some cups of flour.
3. She still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar.

We can represent the amount of flour Mary has already added as ""F"" cups, and the amount of sugar as ""S"" cups. According to the problem, she still needs 8 more cups of flour than sugar, so we can write an equation for this:

 F = << F = S + 8 >> S + 8 

Now, let's consider the total amount of flour needed according to the recipe, which is 6 cups. We can express this as:

 F = << F = 6 >> 6 

And the total amount of sugar needed is 13 cups, which can be represented as:

 S = << S = 13 >> 13 

Now, we have a system of equations:

1.  F = << F = S + 8 >> S + 8 
2.  F = << F = 6 >> 6 
3.  S = << S = 13 >> 13 

We can substitute the values of F and S from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1:

 6 = << 6 = 13 + 8 >> 13 + 8 

Now, we need to solve for the number of cups of flour needed. Subtract 13 from both sides:

 6 - 13 = << 6 - 13 = 13 + 8 - 13 >> 13 + 8 - 13 

 -7 = << -7 = 8 - 13 >> 8 - 13 

Now, subtract 8 from both sides:

 -7 - 8 = << -7 - 8 = 8 - 13 - 8 >> 8 - 13 - 8 

 -15 = << -15 = -5 >> -5 

This equation doesn't make sense; it implies that there is no solution to the problem.

danny collects bottle caps . he found 63 bottle caps at the park while he threw away 51 old ones . now he has 33 bottle caps in his collection . how many bottle caps did danny have at first ?,"Let's break down the information provided in the question:

1. Danny found 63 bottle caps at the park.
2. He threw away 51 old ones.
3. After that, he had 33 bottle caps in his collection.

To find out how many bottle caps Danny had at first, we need to determine his initial collection before he found the 63 bottle caps at the park.

Initial collection + Found at the park - Threw away = Final collection

Let's represent this with equations:

Let C represent Danny's initial collection.

C + 63 (found at the park) - 51 (threw away) = 33 (final collection)

Now, we can solve for C:

C + 63 - 51 = 33

C + 12 = 33

Subtract 12 from both sides:

C = 33 - 12

C = 21

So, Danny initially had 21 bottle caps.

1. Nell starts with 309 baseball cards and 356 sets of 10 cards. To find her total number of cards, we can calculate: 

<<309 + 356 * 10>>.

2. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 415 baseball cards and 149 sets of 10 cards left. To find the number of cards she had left initially, we can calculate:

<<415 + 149 * 10>>.

3. Now, we can find how many more baseball cards Nell has compared to 10 cards by subtracting the number of 10 cards from the number of baseball cards:

<<415 - 149 * 10>>.

4. To get the final answer, we can calculate the difference between the two results from steps 1 and 3:

<<(309 + 356 * 10) - (415 - 149 * 10)>>.

Now, let's calculate this:

 (309 + 356 * 10) - (415 - 149 * 10) = << (309 + 356 * 10) - (415 - 149 * 10) = (309 + 3560) - (415 - 1490) = 3870 - 415 + 1490>> (309 + 3560) - (415 - 1490) = 3870 - 415 + 1490.

Let's simplify this:

3870 - 415 + 1490 = <<3870 - 415 + 1490 = 3455 + 1490>> 3455 + 1490.

Now, let's add these two numbers:

2. Nell also has 214 10 cards.
3. After giving some cards to Jeff, she has 404 baseball cards left.
4. She also has 495 10 cards left.

We need to find out how many more 10 cards Nell has than baseball cards after giving some to Jeff.

First, let's calculate the initial total number of cards:

Initial total cards = Total baseball cards + Total 10 cards
Initial total cards = 246 (baseball cards) + 214 (10 cards)

Now, we know Nell gave some cards to Jeff, so we'll calculate the final total cards:

Final total cards = Total baseball cards left + Total 10 cards left
Final total cards = 404 (baseball cards left) + 495 (10 cards left)

To find out how many more 10 cards than baseball cards Nell has, we need to subtract the final number of baseball cards from the final number of 10 cards:

Difference = Total 10 cards left - Total baseball cards left

Let's do the calculations:

Initial total cards = 246 + 214 = 460
Final total cards = 404 + 495 = 899

Now, find the difference:

Difference = 899 (10 cards left) - 404 (baseball cards left)

Difference = 495

So, Nell has 495 more 10 cards than baseball cards.

 14 t sweet cookies + 9 t salty cookies = << 14 t sweet cookies + 9 t salty cookies = 23 t cookies>> 23 t cookies

Now, we need to subtract the total number of cookies Paco ate from the initial number of cookies to find out how many salty cookies he had left:

 26 t salty cookies - 23 t cookies = << 26 t salty cookies - 23 t cookies = 3 t salty cookies>> 3 t salty cookies

paco had 39 sweet cookies and 6 salty cookies . he ate 23 salty cookies and 32 sweet cookies . how many more sweet cookies than salty cookies did he eat ?,"First, let's find out how many sweet cookies Paco had after eating 32 of them:

\[ 39 t sweet cookies - 32 t sweet cookies eaten = 7 t sweet cookies remaining \]

Next, let's determine how many salty cookies Paco had after eating 23 of them:

\[ 6 t salty cookies - 23 t salty cookies eaten = -17 t salty cookies remaining \]

Since Paco cannot have negative cookies, it means he ate all 6 salty cookies.

Now, let's find out how many more sweet cookies he ate compared to salty cookies:

\[ 32 t sweet cookies eaten - 6 t salty cookies eaten = 26 t more sweet cookies \]

#### 26"
paco had 40 sweet cookies and 25 salty cookies . he ate 28 salty cookies and 15 sweet cookies . how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies did he eat ?,"Paco initially had \(40\) sweet cookies and \(25\) salty cookies.

After eating \(28\) salty cookies, he had \(25 - 28 = -3\) salty cookies left. But we can't have negative cookies, so Paco ate all his salty cookies.

After eating \(15\) sweet cookies, he had \(40 - 15 = 25\) sweet cookies left.

To find out how many more salty cookies than sweet cookies he ate, we subtract the number of sweet cookies left from the initial number of salty cookies:

\(25\) (initial salty cookies) - \(25\) (sweet cookies left) = \(0\)

Paco ate \(0\) more salty cookies than sweet cookies.

for gwen 's birthday she received some dollars . she spent 8 dollars and has 6 dollars left with her . how much money did gwen receive for her birthday ?,"Let's assume that Gwen received <<x for her birthday. 

She spent >>8, so she has <<x - 8 left with her. 

According to the problem, she has >>6 left with her. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

x - 8 = <<x - 8 = 6>> 6

To find the value of x, we can add 8 to both sides of the equation: 

x - 8 + 8 = <<x - 8 + 8 = 6 + 8>> 6 + 8

Simplifying, we get: 

x = <<x = 14>> 14

Therefore, Gwen received $14 for her birthday.

#### 3"
for gwen 's birthday she received 8 dollars from her mom . her dad gave her 5 more dollars . if she spent 4 dollars . how much more money did she receive from her mom than she did from her dad ?,"Gwen received 8 dollars from her mom. Her dad gave her 5 more dollars than her mom, so he gave her \(8 + 5 = 13\) dollars in total. If Gwen spent 4 dollars, we need to find the difference between the money she received from her mom and the money she received from her dad.

From her mom: \(8\) dollars
From her dad: \(13\) dollars

To find the difference, we subtract the money she received from her dad from the money she received from her mom:

\(8 - 13 = -5\)

Gwen received \(5\) dollars more from her dad than she did from her mom.

1. Marco's strawberries weighed 13 pounds.
2. The total weight of strawberries picked by both Marco and his dad is 35 pounds.

To find out how much more his dad's strawberries weighed, we subtract Marco's strawberries' weight from the total weight:

35 - 13 = <<35 - 13 = 22>> 22

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 22 pounds more than Marco's.

#### 22"
marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 30 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 17 pounds . how much more did his strawberries weigh than his dad 's ?,"To find out how much more Marco's strawberries weighed than his dad's, we can subtract his dad's strawberries' weight from Marco's strawberries' weight.

Marco's strawberries = 30 pounds
Together they weighed = 17 pounds

To find how much his dad's strawberries weighed:
Dad's strawberries = Total weight - Marco's strawberries
Dad's strawberries = \( 17 \, tpounds - 30 \, tpounds = -13 \, tpounds \)

Since a negative weight doesn't make sense, there might be an error in the problem statement. It's not possible for the combined weight of Marco and his dad's strawberries to be less than Marco's strawberries alone.

#### 43"
marco and his dad went strawberry picking . marco 's strawberries weighed 10 pounds . if together their strawberries weighed 26 pounds . how much more did his dad 's strawberries weigh than his ?,"To find out how much more Marco's dad's strawberries weighed than Marco's, we can set up an equation based on the given information.

Let's denote the weight of Marco's dad's strawberries as \( D \) pounds.

We know that Marco's strawberries weighed 10 pounds, and together they weighed 26 pounds. So, the equation representing this situation is:

\[ 10 + D = 26 \]

To solve for \( D \), we need to isolate \( D \) on one side of the equation. Subtract 10 from both sides:

\[ D = 26 - 10 \]
\[ D = 16 \]

So, Marco's dad's strawberries weighed 16 pounds more than Marco's.

frank was reading through his favorite book . the book had 193 pages equally distributed over 15 chapters . it took frank 660 days to finish the book . how many chapters did he read per day ?,"To find out how many chapters Frank read per day, we need to divide the total number of chapters by the total number of days it took him to finish the book.

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. The book has 193 pages.
2. The pages are equally distributed over 15 chapters.
3. Frank took 660 days to finish the book.

Now, we can calculate the number of chapters Frank read per day:

Total chapters in the book = 15 (chapters)

Total days it took Frank to finish the book = 660 (days)

Chapters read per day = Total chapters / Total days

Chapters read per day = <<15 / 660>>

\[
tNumber of bananas in each group = 1 / 92}345
\]

Now, we find out how many oranges are in each group. We know that there are 384 oranges in total, and they are organized into 16 groups. To find out how many oranges are in each group, we divide the total number of oranges by the number of orange groups:
\[
tNumber of oranges in each group = \ / textTotal number of oranges}t{Number of orange groups}

brenda 's mother made cookies for 5 . she prepared 22 cookies but had to throw away 17 cookies . if each of them had the same number of cookies how many did each of them have ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Brenda's mother made a total of 22 cookies.
2. Brenda and her mother had to throw away 17 cookies.
3. They had the same number of cookies.

We need to find out how many cookies Brenda and her mother each had before they had to throw away the 17 cookies. To do this, we can set up an equation:

Let's call the number of cookies Brenda and her mother each had before they threw away 17 cookies as ""x"".

So, Brenda had x cookies, and her mother had x cookies.

Now, we know they had to throw away 17 cookies in total. This means:

Brenda threw away x cookies, and her mother threw away x cookies. So, together they threw away 2x cookies.

Now, we can set up an equation:

2x = 17

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2:

2x/2 = 17/2

x = 8.5

So, each of them had 8.5 cookies before they had to throw away 17 cookies.

Let's call the number of guests Brenda's mother prepared cookies for ""G"", and the number of cookies each guest had ""C"". We're given that each guest had 2 cookies, and the total number of cookies prepared is 10. So we can write the equation:

G * C = <<G * C = 10>> 10

Now, we can solve for G:

G = <<G = 1 / 0C>> 1 / 0C

Since each guest had 2 cookies:

G = <<G = 1 / 02>> 1 / 02

Now, calculate the value of G:

G = <<G = 5>> 5

So, Brenda's mother prepared cookies for 5 guests.

Given that Shirley sold 10 boxes and needs to deliver 5 cases, we can set up the following equation:

 tTotal number of boxes = << tTotal number of boxes = tNumber of boxes per case * tNumber of cases >> tNumber of boxes per case * tNumber of cases 

Let's solve for the number of boxes per case:

 10 = << 10 = tNumber of boxes per case * 5 >> tNumber of boxes per case * 5 

To isolate the variable, we divide both sides of the equation by 5:

 1 / 05 = << 1 / 05 = \ / textNumber of boxes per case * 5}5 >> \ / textNumber of boxes per case * 5}5 

Simplifying further:

 2 = << 2 = tNumber of boxes per case >> tNumber of boxes per case

So he needs <<146g>> more wax.
#### 146"
next on his checklist are wax to stick the feathers together . if he has 557 g of wax and right now he just needs 17 g total how many grams of wax do the feathers require ?,"To find out how many grams of wax the feathers require, we need to subtract the amount of wax he already has (17 g) from the total amount of wax he needs.

Total amount of wax needed = Amount of wax he already has + Amount of wax the feathers require

Let's denote the amount of wax the feathers require as ""x"".

Therefore, the equation becomes:

x + 17 g = 557 g

To isolate ""x"" on one side of the equation, we need to subtract 17 g from both sides:

x = 557 g - 17 g

Simplifying the right side:

x = 540 g

Hence, the feathers require 540 grams of wax.

being his favorite he saved checking on the grapevines for his last stop . he was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day . how many days will it take to fill 240 drums of grapes ?,"  Here is my step-by-step solution to the math problem:

The problem statement says:

he was told by 36 of the pickers that they fill 8 drums of grapes per day.

So each picker can fill <<8>> drums of grapes per day.

There are <<36>> pickers.

So together they can fill 8 * 36 = <<8 * 36 = 288>> 288 drums of grapes per day.

The question asks: how many days will it take to fill <<240>> drums of grapes?

We need to find the number of days it will take <<36>> pickers filling <<288>> drums of grapes per day to fill <<240>> drums of grapes.

We can set up a proportion:

240>> drums of grapes / <<x>> days of work  = <<240>> drums of grapes / <<x>> days of work  = <<288>> <<288 drums of grapes / <<1>> day of work

Solving for <<x>>:

x>> = <<x>> = <<240>> <<240 drums of grapes / (<<288>> drums of grapes / <<1>> day of work)

x>> = <<x>> = <<240>> <<240 / <<288>> 

x>> = <<x>> = <<0.8333...>> <<0.8333... days

So it will take <<0.83>> days or approximately <<8>> hours for <<36>> pickers filling <<288>> drums of grapes per day to fill <<240>> drums of grapes.

for the walls of the house he would use 4 nails in all to secture large planks of wood . if each plank of wood needs 2 pieces of nails to be secured how many planks does john need for the house wall ?,"To find out how many planks John needs for the house wall, we can start by determining how many nails he will use and then use that information to calculate the number of planks.

Given:
- John uses 4 nails in total.
- Each plank of wood needs 2 nails to be secured.

To find the number of planks, we can set up a simple division. We'll divide the total number of nails used by the number of nails needed to secure each plank.

4 t nails / 2 t nails per plank = <<4 t nails / 2 t nails per plank = 2 t planks>> 2 t planks

So, John needs 2 planks for the house wall.

for the walls of the house he would use 11 nails in all to secture large planks of wood . if each plank needs 3 pieces of nails to be secured and an additional 8 nails were used . how many planks does john need for the house wall ?,"To find out how many planks John needs for the house wall, we can start by calculating the total number of nails he has used and then figure out how many planks they would secure. 

John used a total of 11 nails to secure the planks. He used 8 additional nails on top of that. So, the total number of nails used is:

11 + 8 = <<11 + 8 = 19>> 19

Now, we know that each plank needs 3 nails to be secured. To find out how many planks John needs, we can divide the total number of nails used by the number of nails needed for each plank:

19 / 3 = <<19 / 3 = 6.333...>> 6.333...

Since you can't have a fraction of a plank, John would need to round up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a plank in reality. So, John needs:

for the walls of the house he would use 12 large planks of wood and 17 small planks . if each large plank of wood needs 14 pieces of nails to be secured and each small plank needs 25 nails . how many planks does john need for the house wall ?,"To find out how many planks John needs for the house wall, we can start by calculating the total number of nails required for both the large and small planks, and then use that information to determine the number of planks needed.

First, we'll calculate the number of nails needed for the large planks:
- John will use 12 large planks.
- Each large plank needs 14 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the large planks is <<12 * 14>>.

Next, let's calculate the number of nails needed for the small planks:
- John will use 17 small planks.
- Each small plank needs 25 nails.

So, the total number of nails needed for the small planks is <<17 * 25>>.

Now, we can add the number of nails needed for both the large and small planks to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = (<<12 * 14>>) + (<<17 * 25>>)

Now, let's calculate this expression:

Total nails needed = <<168 + 425>>

Now, we can add these two values together to find the total number of nails needed for the house wall:

Total nails needed = 168 + 425 = <<168 + 425 = 593>> 593

So, John needs 593 nails for the house wall. Now, to find the total number of planks, we can divide this number by the number of nails needed for each plank, which is 14 for large planks and 25 for small planks:

Total planks needed = <<c59314 + 25>>
Total planks needed = <<c59339>>

Now, let's calculate this division:

Total planks needed ≈ 15.2051 (rounded to 4 decimal places)

So, John needs approximately 15.2051 planks for the house wall. Since you can't have a fraction of a plank, he will need 16 planks for the house wall.

Lucy bought 2 packs of cookies and 12 packs of cake, so the total cost of her groceries can be expressed as <<2c + 12k>>. 

The amount of change she had remaining is <<56>>, so we can set up the equation:

\[2c + 12k + 56 = 0\]

Now, let's express the cost of the groceries in terms of the change:

\[2c + 12k = 56\]

We need to find the total number of packs of groceries, which is \(2 + 12\). Now, we can substitute \(2c + 12k\) with \(56\) in this expression:

1. Zachary did 15 push-ups.
2. David did 39 more push-ups than Zachary, which means David did <<15 + 39>> push-ups.
3. John did 9 push-ups less than David, which means John did <<(15 + 39) - 9>> push-ups.

Now, we can calculate the number of push-ups each person did:

- Zachary: <<15>> push-ups
- David: 15 + 39 = <<15 + 39 = 54>> 54 push-ups
- John: (15 + 39) - 9 = <<(15 + 39) - 9 = 45>> 45 push-ups

Finally, let's find out how many more push-ups Zachary did than John:

15 - 45 = <<15 - 45 = -30>> -30 ####. 

Since a negative value doesn't make sense in this context (you can't do negative push-ups), we'll take the absolute value:

mary is baking a cake . the recipe calls for 10 cups of flour 2 cups of sugar and 80 cups of salt . she already put in 7 cups of flour . how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar does she need to add now ?,"To find out how many more cups of flour Mary needs to add than cups of sugar, we first need to determine the difference between the cups of flour and cups of sugar in the recipe. 

The recipe calls for 10 cups of flour and 2 cups of sugar. So, the initial difference is \(10 - 2 = 8\) cups of flour more than cups of sugar in the recipe.

Mary has already added 7 cups of flour, so she needs to add \(10 - 7 = 3\) more cups of flour to match the recipe. 

To find out how many more cups of flour than cups of sugar she needs to add, we subtract the cups of sugar from the additional cups of flour: \(3 - 2 = 1\).

Therefore, Mary needs to add 1 more cup of flour than cups of sugar.

dan has 4 . for a total of 3 he bought 10 candy bar each one costing the same amount of money . how much money is left ?,"Dan has 4 dollars.
He bought 10 candy bars, each costing the same amount of money.
To find out how much money is left, we need to subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount of money Dan had.

To find the total cost of the candy bars, we need to multiply the cost of one candy bar by the number of candy bars.

Let's say the cost of one candy bar is <<x.
So, the total cost of the candy bars is >>10x.

To find the amount of money left, we need to subtract the total cost of the candy bars from the initial amount of money Dan had.

Initial amount of money = <<4
Total cost of candy bars = >>10x

Amount of money left = Initial amount of money - Total cost of candy bars
Amount of money left = <<4 - >>10x

So, the amount of money left is <<4 - >>10x.

paul had 21 books . after selling some in a garage sale he bought 42 new ones . if he has 15 books now how many more books did he sell than he bought ?,"Let's assume that Paul sold x books in the garage sale. 

Before the garage sale, Paul had 21 books. After selling some, he had 21 - x books left. 

After the garage sale, Paul bought 42 new books. So, he had 21 - x + 42 books in total. 

Now, we are given that Paul has 15 books. So, we can set up the equation: 

21 - x + 42 = 15 

To find the value of x, we can simplify the equation:

there were 21 roses in the vase . jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase and cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase . there are now 15 roses in the vase . how many more roses did she throw away than those she cut from her garden ?,"Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Initially, there were 21 roses in the vase.
2. Jessica threw away 34 roses from the vase.
3. Jessica also cut some more new roses from her flower garden to put in the vase.
4. After all these actions, there are now 15 roses in the vase.

To find out how many more roses Jessica threw away than those she cut from her garden, we need to calculate the difference between the number of roses she threw away and the number of roses she cut.

First, let's calculate the total number of roses Jessica had after throwing away 34 roses:
21 - 34 = <<21 - 34 = -13>> -13

Since we can't have a negative number of roses, this means that Jessica must have cut more roses from her garden than she threw away. 

To find out how many more roses she threw away than those she cut, we need to calculate the absolute value of the difference between the two quantities. In this case, it would be the absolute value of -13, which is 13.

Therefore, Jessica threw away 13 more roses than those she cut from her garden.

2. Jessica cut some more roses from her flower garden, which had a total of 12 roses.
3. After adding the roses she cut to the vase, there are now 21 roses in the vase.

Let's denote the number of roses Jessica cut as \(x\). 

So, we have the equation:

Initial roses in the vase + Roses Jessica cut = Total roses in the vase

\(13 + x = 21\)

To find out how many roses are left in the garden, we need to subtract the roses Jessica cut from the total roses in her garden:

Total roses in the garden - Roses Jessica cut = Roses left in the garden

\(12 - x = ####\)

Solving the first equation:

\(x = 8\)

Now, substituting \(x\) into the second equation:

\(12 - 8 = ####\)

\(4 = ####\)

danny collects bottle caps and wrappers . he found 11 bottle caps and 28 wrappers at the park . now he has 68 bottle caps and 51 wrappers in his collection . how many more wrappers than bottle caps did danny find at the park ?," Here is the step-by-step solution:

Danny found <<11>> bottle caps and <<28>> wrappers at the park.
He now has <<68>> bottle caps and <<51>> wrappers in his collection.
So before finding these at the park, he had 68-11= <<68-11= 57>> 57 bottle caps and 51-28 = <<51-28 = 23>> 23 wrappers.  

Therefore, at the park he found:
<<11>> bottle caps 
<<28>> wrappers

Now to calculate how many more wrappers than bottle caps he found at the park:
28>> wrappers - <<11>> bottle caps = <<28>> wrappers - <<11>> bottle caps = <<17>> <<17 more wrappers

Now, let's calculate the difference in the number of wrappers:
43 - 62 = <<43 - 62 = -19>> -19

Danny has 17 more bottle caps than wrappers, or we can say he has 19 more wrappers than bottle caps (but the difference is negative, indicating he has fewer wrappers).

danny collects bottle caps and wrappers . he found 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps at the park . now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers in his collection . how many bottle caps did danny have at first ?,"Let's use a step-by-step approach to solve this problem.

1. Initially, Danny had 82 wrappers and 29 bottle caps.
2. Now he has 42 bottle caps and 61 wrappers.
3. Let's calculate how many wrappers and bottle caps he started with.

To find the initial number of bottle caps, we can subtract the current number of bottle caps from the number of bottle caps he started with:

Initial bottle caps = 29 (initial) - 42 (current) = 29 - 42 = -13

Now, let's find the initial number of wrappers by subtracting the current number of wrappers from the number of wrappers he started with:

Initial wrappers = 82 (initial) - 61 (current) = 82 - 61 = 21

So, Danny initially had -13 bottle caps and 21 wrappers. However, a negative number of bottle caps doesn't make sense in this context. It's likely there was an error in the problem statement or data provided.

there were 106 dollars in olivia 's wallet . after she visited a supermarket and a showroom there were 26 dollars left . if she spent 49 dollars at the showroom how much did she spend at the supermarket ?,"Let's set up an equation to represent the given information. Olivia started with 106 dollars in her wallet. After visiting the supermarket and showroom, she had 26 dollars left. We know that she spent 49 dollars at the showroom. Let's represent the amount she spent at the supermarket as ""x"". 

Total amount spent = Amount spent at showroom + Amount spent at supermarket
106 - 26 = 49 + x

Now, let's solve for ""x"" to find out how much Olivia spent at the supermarket.

dave had 21 apps on his phone . he added 89 new apps . after deleting some he had 24 left . how many more apps did he add than he deleted ?,"Let's assume that Dave deleted ""x"" number of apps.

Dave started with 21 apps on his phone, added 89 new apps, and then deleted ""x"" apps. This means that after deleting ""x"" apps, he had 24 apps left.

So, the equation representing this situation would be: 21 + 89 - x = 24.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve the equation:

110 - x = 24.

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 24 from both sides of the equation:

110 - 24 - x = 24 - 24.

This simplifies to:

86 - x = 0.

To isolate ""x"", we can subtract 86 from both sides of the equation:

86 - x - 86 = 0 - 86.

This simplifies to:

-x = -86.

To solve for ""x"", we can multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-86).

This simplifies to:

x = 86.

Therefore, Dave deleted 86 apps.

To find out how many more apps Dave added than he deleted, we can subtract the number of deleted apps from the number of added apps:

89 - 86 = ####.

Hence, Dave added 3 more apps than he deleted.

faye was placing her pencils into rows with 22 pencils in each row . she had 6 packs of pencils each one having 14 pencils . how many pencils does she have ?,"To find out how many pencils Faye has, we can break it down step by step:

1. Faye has 6 packs of pencils, and each pack contains 14 pencils. So, the total number of pencils in the packs is <<6 * 14>>.

2. Faye also placed some pencils into rows, with 22 pencils in each row. We don't know how many rows she has, so we'll represent that as <<R>>. The total number of pencils in the rows is <<22 * R>>.

3. To find the total number of pencils Faye has, we need to add the pencils from the packs and the pencils from the rows. So, the equation is: Total pencils = Pencils in packs + Pencils in rows.

Now, let's calculate it:

Total pencils = <<(6 * 14) + (22 * R)>>

Since we don't know the value of $R,"" we'll keep it as it is.

after eating a hearty meal they went to see the buckingham palace . there rachel learned that 703 visitors came to the buckingham palace on the previous day . if there were 246 visitors on that day how many visited the buckingham palace within 25 days ?

<<703>> visitors came to the Buckingham Palace on the previous day.
<<246>> visitors came on that day.
We need to find the total visitors within <<25>> days.

Let's call the number of visitors on the remaining <<24>> days as <<x>>.  

Then, total visitors = visitors on that day + visitors on previous day + visitors on remaining <<24>> days
              = <<246 + 703 +x>>

Since we need the total visitors within <<25>> days, we can set up a proportion:

Solving for <<x>>:
x = <<x = 703 * 24 = 16872>> 703 * 24 = 16872

Total visitors = <<= 246 + 703 + 16872 = 17821>> 246 + 703 + 16872 = 17821

Therefore, <<17821>> visitors visited the Buckingham Palace within <<25>> days.

1. You have 26 bags.
2. Each bag contains an equal number of cookies.
3. You also have 15 candies.
4. In total, you have 52 cookies.

To find out how many bags of cookies you have, we can set up an equation. Let's call the number of cookies in each bag ""C.""

Now, we know that you have 15 candies, which are not cookies, and you have 52 cookies in total. So, we can write an equation for the total number of cookies:

Total number of cookies = Number of bags * Number of cookies in each bag

Mathematically, this can be represented as:
 52 = << 52 = 26C >> 26C 

Now, we need to solve for ""C,"" which represents the number of cookies in each bag. To do that, we can divide both sides of the equation by 26:

 5 / 226 = << 5 / 226 = C >> C 

Simplifying the right side:

 2 = << 2 = C >> C 

So, you have 2 cookies in each bag. Now, to find out how many bags of cookies you have, you can simply use the information given in the problem:

You have 26 bags, and each bag has 2 cookies.

The mailman gives 5 pieces of junk mail to each block.

If he gives 25 mails to each house in a block, we can calculate the number of houses in a block by dividing the total number of pieces of junk mail given to a block by the number of mails given to each house:

Total mail per block / Mail per house = Number of houses in a block

5 / 25 = <<5 / 25 = 0.2>> 0.2

1. First, calculate the number of houses in total:
   Number of houses in each block = 17
   Number of blocks = 16
   Total number of houses = 17 * 16

2. Next, calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail by multiplying the number of houses by the number of pieces of junk mail per house:
   Total number of pieces of junk mail = Total number of houses * Number of pieces of junk mail per house

Now, let's perform the calculations:

1. Total number of houses = 17 * 16 = 272

2. Total number of pieces of junk mail = 272 * 4

Now, calculate the total number of pieces of junk mail:

Total number of pieces of junk mail = 272 * 4 = 1088

So, the mailman should give a total of 1088 pieces of junk mail in total.

rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11 . if each group has 2 eggs how many eggs does rebecca have ?,"Rebecca wants to split a collection of eggs into groups of 11, and each group should have 2 eggs. We can find out how many eggs Rebecca has by dividing the total number of eggs by the number of eggs in each group.

Let's represent the total number of eggs as ""E"" and the number of eggs in each group as ""G.""

<< E >> divided by << G >> will give us the number of groups, and then we can multiply that by the number of eggs in each group to find the total number of eggs.

So, the calculation is:
 E / G = << E / G = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * G = << tNumber of groups * G = tTotal number of eggs >> tTotal number of eggs 

In this case:
 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * 2 = << tNumber of groups * 2 = tTotal number of eggs >> tTotal number of eggs 

Now, we just need to solve for the total number of eggs.

 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * 2 = << tNumber of groups * 2 = tTotal number of eggs >> tTotal number of eggs 

Assuming that the number of groups will be a whole number, we can find the total number of eggs.

Let's say the total number of eggs is ""X"":

 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * 2 = << tNumber of groups * 2 = X >> X 

Now, we can use these equations to find the total number of eggs.

 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 
 tNumber of groups * 2 = << tNumber of groups * 2 = X >> X 

We need to isolate ""X,"" so we can start by solving for the number of groups:

 E / 11 = << E / 11 = tNumber of groups >> tNumber of groups 

And then use that value to find ""X"":

 tNumber of groups * 2 = << tNumber of groups * 2 = X >> X 

Now, let's calculate ""X.""

Let's say, for example, Rebecca has 22 eggs.

 22 / 11 = << 22 / 11 = 2 >> 2 
 2 * 2 = << 2 * 2 = 4 >> 4 

So, if Rebecca has 22 eggs and wants to split them into groups of 11 with 2 eggs in each group, she has a total of 4 eggs.

the ring toss game at the carnival made the same amount of money each day . in total in 30 days they earned 420 dollars . together with game they earned 22 dollars . how much did ring toss game make per day ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The total earnings in 30 days is <<420.

2. Together with the ring toss game, they earned >>22.

To find out how much the ring toss game made per day, we'll first subtract the earnings from the game they made together with the <<22 from the total earnings of >>420:

Total earnings - Earnings from other games = Earnings from the ring toss game
<<420 - >>22 = Earnings from the ring toss game

Now, we can calculate the earnings from the ring toss game per day by dividing the total earnings from the ring toss game by the number of days (30):

Earnings from the ring toss game / Number of days = Earnings per day
(Earnings from the ring toss game) / 30 = Earnings per day

Let's calculate it:

(<<420 - >>22) / 30 = Earnings per day
<<398 / 30 = Earnings per day

Now, perform the division:

>>398 / 30 = 13.27

So, the ring toss game made approximately $13.27 per day.

a tourist group has 26 people . at a hotel they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each . in order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied how many large rooms should be rented ?,"To find the number of large rooms that should be rented in order to have every room fully occupied with the least number of rooms, we can use the concept of division.

Let's assume the number of large rooms to be rented as ""x"". Since each large room can accommodate 3 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""x"" large rooms would be 3x.

Similarly, let's assume the number of small rooms to be rented as ""y"". Since each small room can accommodate 2 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""y"" small rooms would be 2y.

According to the given information, there are a total of 26 people in the tourist group. Therefore, we can write an equation based on the total number of people:

3x + 2y = 26

To minimize the number of rooms required, we need to find the smallest possible values for ""x"" and ""y"" that satisfy this equation.

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start with assuming a value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 0 (i.e., no large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 0 into the equation: 
   3(0) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying: 
   2y = 26
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 13

   So, if no large rooms are rented (x = 0), we would need to rent 13 small rooms.

2. Now, let's assume a value for ""x"" again. Let's assume x = 1 (i.e., one large room is rented).

   Substituting x = 1 into the equation:
   3(1) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying:
   3 + 2y = 26
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   2y = 23
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 11.5

   Since the number of rooms must be a whole number, we cannot have a fraction of a room. Therefore, assuming x = 1 does not give us a valid solution.

3. Let's assume another value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 2 (i.e., two large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 2 into the

According to the problem, the farmer harvests 684 more bushels of wheat than expected. Therefore, the total number of bushels harvested can be calculated by adding the expected harvest (<<x>>) and the additional 684 bushels.

So, the equation representing this situation is:

x + 684 = <<x + 684 = 48097>> 48097

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 684 from both sides:

x = <<x = 48097 - 684>> 48097 - 684

Now, let's calculate this expression:

x = <<x = 47413>> 47413

Therefore, the farmer harvests 47,413 bushels of wheat.

It took me 6 minutes to walk 500 meters . How fast was I travelling ?,"To find the speed at which you were traveling, we can use the formula: 

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is 500 meters and the time taken is 6 minutes. However, we need to convert the time into hours since speed is typically measured in units of distance per unit of time. 

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60:

Time (in hours) = 6 minutes / 60 = 0.1 hours

Now we can calculate the speed:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 500 meters / 0.1 hours

To simplify the calculation, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 0.1:

Speed = (500 meters / 0.1 hours) / 0.1
Speed = 5000 meters / 1 hour

So you were traveling at a speed of 5000 meters per hour.

an online toy store stocked some toys . it sold 38 toys at the first week and 26 toys at the second week . if it had 19 toys left how many toys were in stock at the beginning ?,"Sure, I'd be happy to help you solve the math problem step by step!

Let's assume the number of toys in stock at the beginning is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, the store sold 38 toys in the first week and 26 toys in the second week. So the total number of toys sold is <<38 + 26>>.

To find the number of toys left in stock, we subtract the total number of toys sold from the initial number of toys in stock: <<x - (38 + 26)>>.

The problem states that there were 19 toys left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - (38 + 26) = <<x - (38 + 26) = 19>> 19.

Now, let's solve for <<x>>.

First, let's simplify the equation by calculating 38 + 26>>: <<x - 64 = <<38 + 26>>: <<x - 64 = 19>> 19.

Next, we isolate the variable x>> by adding 64 to both sides of the equation: <<x = <<x>> by adding 64 to both sides of the equation: <<x = 19 + 64>> 19 + 64.

Finally, we calculate the sum on the right side of the equation: x = <<x = 83>> 83.

So, the initial number of toys in stock was 83.

"When Jake had 1 cat , he needed to serve 0.5 can of cat food each day . Now that Jake has adopted a second cat , he needs to serve a total of 0.9 can each day . How much extra food is needed to feed the second cat ?","Let's assume that the amount of cat food needed to feed one cat is represented by the variable <<x>>. 

According to the information given, when Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 cans of cat food each day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

1  x = <<1  x = 0.5>> 0.5

Simplifying this equation, we find that x = <<x = 0.5>> 0.5.

Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans each day. We can set up another equation to represent this situation:

2  x = <<2  x = 0.9>> 0.9

Simplifying this equation, we find that x = <<x = 0.45>> 0.45.

To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we need to calculate the difference between the amount of food needed for two cats and the amount of food needed for one cat:

<<0.45 - 0.5>>

Simplifying this expression, we find that the extra food needed to feed the second cat is:

there are 32 students in the class . the teacher divided them into 5 equal groups . how many students are there in each group ?,"To find out how many students are in each group, we can divide the total number of students by the number of groups they were divided into.

Given:
Total number of students = 32
Number of groups = 5

To find the number of students in each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

 tNumber of students in each group = << tNumber of students in each group = \ / textTotal number of students}t{Number of groups} >> \ / textTotal number of students}t{Number of groups} 

Substituting the given values:

 tNumber of students in each group = << tNumber of students in each group = 3 / 25 >> 3 / 25 

Performing the division:

 tNumber of students in each group = << tNumber of students in each group = 6.4 >> 6.4 

However, since we cannot have a fraction of a student, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 6 students in each group.

Dividing both sides by >>2, we find:
x = <<10 / >>2
x = <<5

Therefore, each mouse costs >>5.

To calculate the total amount earned from selling 34 mice, we multiply the cost per mouse by the total number of mice sold:
Total earnings = Cost per mouse * Total number of mice
Total earnings = <<5 * 34

Calculating this expression gives us:

a chef had 46 apples . after making some pies he had 14 left . how many apples did he use ?,"Let's denote the number of apples the chef used as ""x"". 

The chef started with 46 apples and after making some pies, he had 14 left. This can be represented as an equation: 

46 - x = 14

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 14 from both sides:

46 - 14 - x = 14 - 14
32 - x = 0

Now, to solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it completely. We can do this by subtracting 32 from both sides:

32 - x - 32 = 0 - 32
-x = -32

To get the value of ""x"" alone, we multiply both sides by -1 (since multiplying or dividing both sides of an equation by a negative number reverses the inequality):

Tom went to 4 hockey games this year and missed 7. So, the total number of games he attended this year can be calculated by subtracting the number of games he missed from the total number of games played this year: 4 - 7 = <<4 - 7 = -3>> -3.

However, it doesn't make sense for Tom to have attended a negative number of games. Therefore, we can conclude that there might be an error in the given information.

Additionally, it is mentioned that Tom went to 9 games last year. To find the total number of hockey games Tom went to in all, we need to add the number of games he attended this year (which is currently unclear) and the number of games he attended last year: -3 + 9 = <<-3 + 9 = 6>> 6.

Therefore, based on the given information, Tom went to a total of 6 hockey games in all.

A carpenter bought a piece of wood that was 0.41 meters long . Then she sawed 0.33 meters off the end . How long is the piece of wood now ?,"To find the length of the piece of wood after sawing off 0.33 meters, we need to subtract 0.33 from the original length of 0.41 meters.

Original length of the wood = 0.41 meters
Length sawed off = 0.33 meters

To find the remaining length, we subtract the length sawed off from the original length:

Remaining length = Original length - Length sawed off
Remaining length = 0.41 meters - 0.33 meters

Subtracting decimals can be done by aligning the decimal points and subtracting each place value:

   0.41
- 0.33
-------
   0.08

Therefore, the piece of wood is now 0.08 meters long.

"Sam was collecting cans for recycling . On Saturday he filled 3 bags up and on Sunday he filled 4 more bags . If each bag had 9 cans in it , how many cans did he pick up total ?","To find the total number of cans Sam picked up, we need to calculate the number of cans in each bag and then add them together.

First, we know that on Saturday, Sam filled 3 bags. Since each bag had 9 cans in it, we can calculate the number of cans on Saturday by multiplying the number of bags (3) by the number of cans per bag (9).

 3 * 9 = << 3 * 9 = 27 >> 27 

So on Saturday, Sam picked up 27 cans.

Next, we know that on Sunday, Sam filled 4 more bags. Again, each bag had 9 cans in it. So we can calculate the number of cans on Sunday by multiplying the number of bags (4) by the number of cans per bag (9).

 4 * 9 = << 4 * 9 = 36 >> 36 

Therefore, on Sunday, Sam picked up 36 cans.

To find the total number of cans Sam picked up, we need to add the number of cans from Saturday and Sunday together.

 27 + 36 = << 27 + 36 = 63 >> 63 

Therefore, Sam picked up a total of 63 cans.

"At a restaurant each adult meal costs 3 and kids eat free . If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids , how much would it cost for the group to eat ?","To find out how much it would cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, we need to calculate the cost of the adult meals. 

Given that each adult meal costs <<3 and there were 12 people in total, with 7 of them being kids, we can calculate the number of adults in the group by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 12 - 7

Now that we know the number of adults, we can calculate the cost of their meals by multiplying the number of adults by the cost per adult meal.

Cost of adult meals = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Cost of adult meals = (12 - 7) * >>3

Simplifying this calculation:

Cost of adult meals = 5 * <<3
Cost of adult meals = >>15

Therefore, it would cost $15 for the group to eat at the restaurant.

"On a recent trip to CA , we averaged 50 miles per hour . On the return trip we averaged 60 miles per hour . Determine the average speed of the trip to CA and back .","To determine the average speed of the trip to CA and back, we can use the concept of harmonic mean. The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

Let's assume that the distance to CA is D miles. Therefore, the distance back from CA is also D miles.

The time taken to travel to CA at an average speed of 50 miles per hour can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. So, the time taken to travel to CA is D / 50 hours.

Similarly, the time taken to travel back from CA at an average speed of 60 miles per hour is D / 60 hours.

The total distance traveled for the round trip is 2D miles (D miles to CA + D miles back from CA).

The total time taken for the round trip is (D / 50) + (D / 60) hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.

Substituting in the values we have:

average speed = (2D) / ((D / 50) + (D / 60))

To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator for (D / 50) and (D / 60). The least common multiple of 50 and 60 is 300.

average speed = (2D) / ((6D/300) + (5D/300))

Combining like terms:

average speed = (2D) / ((11D/300))

Dividing both numerator and denominator by D:

average speed = (2/11) * (300)

Calculating this expression:

average speed = 600/11

"Mike went to 15 basketball games this year , but missed 41 . He went to 39 games last year . How many basketball games did Mike go to in total ?","To find the total number of basketball games Mike went to, we need to add the number of games he went to this year and the number of games he went to last year.

This year, Mike went to 15 basketball games but missed 41. So the total number of games he attended this year can be calculated as:

15 - 41 = <<15 - 41 = -26>> -26

However, since it is not possible to attend a negative number of games, we can assume that Mike actually attended 0 games this year.

Last year, Mike went to 39 basketball games. 

To find the total number of games Mike went to in both years, we can add the number of games from this year and last year:

0 + 39 = <<0 + 39 = 39>> 39

Therefore, Mike went to a total of 39 basketball games.

First, let's calculate the time spent on chairs. Maria bought 2 new chairs, and she spent 8 minutes on each chair. We can find the total time spent on chairs by multiplying the number of chairs (2) by the time spent on each chair (8).

 2 * 8 = << 2 * 8 = 16 >> 16 

So, Maria spent a total of 16 minutes on chairs.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on tables. Maria bought 2 new tables, and she also spent 8 minutes on each table. We can find the total time spent on tables by multiplying the number of tables (2) by the time spent on each table (8).

 2 * 8 = << 2 * 8 = 16 >> 16 

Therefore, Maria spent a total of 16 minutes on tables.

To find the total time it took her to finish, we need to add the time spent on chairs and tables together.

to get to school chad must either walk around a circular lake or canoe across it . the diameter of the lake is 2 miles . how much shorter is his trip if he canoes across the lake rather than walks around it ? ( use the value of pi = 3 ),"To find out how much shorter Chad's trip is if he canoes across the lake rather than walking around it, we need to calculate the circumference of the lake and compare it to the diameter.

The formula for the circumference of a circle is given by C = <<C =  * d>>  * d, where <<C>> represents the circumference and <<d>> represents the diameter.

Given that the diameter of the lake is 2 miles and using the value of  = << = 3>> 3, we can substitute these values into the formula to find the circumference.

for halloween tom received 20 pieces of candy . if he put them into piles with 5 in each pile how many piles could he make ?,"To solve this problem, we need to divide the total number of candies by the number of candies in each pile.

First, let's define the variables:

- <<x>> represents the number of piles Tom can make.
- <<y>> represents the number of candies in each pile.

The problem states that Tom received 20 candies. If he puts them into piles with 5 candies each, he can make <<x>> piles. We can write this as:

20 = <<20 = 5x>> 5x

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

x = <<x = 2 / 05>> 2 / 05

Now, let's calculate the value of <<x>>:

x = <<x = 4>> 4

So, Tom could make 4 piles of candies each with 5 candies.

olivia owned 93 pennies . after she bought an apple she had 56 pennies left . how many did she spend for the apple ?,"Let's assume that Olivia spent <<x>> pennies for the apple. 

Initially, Olivia owned 93 pennies, so we can represent this as:
<<93 - x>>

After buying the apple, Olivia had 56 pennies left, so we can represent this as:
93 - x = <<93 - x = 56>> 56

To find the value of <<x>>, we need to solve this equation for <<x>>. 

Subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation gives us:
93 - x - 56 = <<93 - x - 56 = 56 - 56>> 56 - 56
37 - x = <<37 - x = 0>> 0

To isolate <<x>>, we subtract 37 from both sides of the equation:
37 - x - 37 = <<37 - x - 37 = 0 - 37>> 0 - 37
-x = <<-x = -37>> -37

Finally, multiplying both sides of the equation by -1 gives us the value of <<x>>:
x = <<x = 37>> 37

Therefore, Olivia spent 37 pennies for the apple.

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:

7x = 55 - 6

Simplifying the right side:

7x = 49

Now, to solve for x, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 49 / 7

Simplifying the right side:

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

What fraction of the apartments are either 1 - or two - bedroom apartments ?","To find the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom, we need to add the fractions of one-bedroom and two-bedroom apartments together.

The fraction of one-bedroom apartments is 0.16666666666666666, and the fraction of two-bedroom apartments is 0.3333333333333333.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The smallest number that both 6 and 3 divide into evenly is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6:
- The fraction of one-bedroom apartments becomes 1/6 (since 1 multiplied by 6 equals 6).
- The fraction of two-bedroom apartments becomes 2/6 (since 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6).

Now we can add these fractions together:
1/6 + 2/6 = (1 + 2)/6 = 3/6

Simplifying the fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:
3/6 = (3 / 3)/(6 / 3) = 1/2

Therefore, the fraction of apartments that are either one-bedroom or two-bedroom is 1/2.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that each basket contains 25 apples.
2. We also know that Mr. Lee has 495 apples in total.

To find out how many baskets he has, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each basket. In mathematical terms, this is represented as:

` Number of baskets = << Number of baskets = Total number of apples / Apples per basket >> Total number of apples / Apples per basket `

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

` Number of baskets = << Number of baskets = 495 apples / 25 apples/basket >> 495 apples / 25 apples/basket `

This simplifies to:

` Number of baskets = << Number of baskets = 19.8 baskets >> 19.8 baskets `

Since we can't have a fraction of a basket, we round this number up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Mr. Lee has 20 baskets of apples.

"Jenny sold 24 boxes of Trefoils . How many cases of 8 boxes , plus extra boxes does Jenny need to deliver ?","To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cases of 8 boxes Jenny needs to deliver, and how many extra boxes are left over.


Step 1: Determine the number of full cases

We can calculate the number of full cases by dividing the total number of boxes by the number of boxes in a case. In this case, Jenny sold 24 boxes of Trefoils and each case contains 8 boxes. 

So, the calculation would be:

 24 / 8 = << 24 / 8 = 3 >> 3 

This means Jenny needs to deliver 3 full cases of 8 boxes each.

Step 2: Calculate the number of extra boxes

We can calculate the number of extra boxes by finding the remainder of the division from Step 1. 

The calculation would be:

 24  8 = << 24  8 = 0 >> 0 

This means there are no extra boxes left over, as the total number of boxes sold is a multiple of the number of boxes in a case.

A man starts walking for the first week and walks 10 miles . Every week he increases the distance by 2 miles . How many miles does he walk by the 8th week ?,"To find out how many miles the man walks by the 8th week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each week and then add them up.

In the first week, he walks 10 miles.
In the second week, he walks 10 + 2 = 12 miles.
In the third week, he walks 12 + 2 = 14 miles.
And so on...

We can see that the distance increases by 2 miles each week. So, we can use a formula to calculate the total distance walked by the 8th week.

The formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series is:
 S_n = << S_n = n / 2(a_1 + a_n) >> n / 2(a_1 + a_n) 

Where:
<< S_n >> is the sum of the series,
<< n >> is the number of terms in the series,
<< a_1 >> is the first term in the series, and
<< a_n >> is the last term in the series.

In this case, we have:
 n = << n = 8 >> 8  (since we want to find out how many miles he walks by the 8th week),
 a_1 = << a_1 = 10 >> 10  (the first term is 10 miles), and
 a_n = << a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d >> a_1 + (n-1)d  (where << d >> is the common difference between terms).

Since the common difference between terms is 2 miles, we can substitute these values into our formula:

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + (8-1)2) >> 8 / 2(10 + (8-1)2) 

Simplifying further:

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + 7  2) >> 8 / 2(10 + 7  2) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(10 + 14) >> 8 / 2(10 + 14) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 8 / 2(24) >> 8 / 2(24) 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 4  24 >> 4  24 

 S_8 = << S_8 = 96 >> 96

"You deposit 70 dollars in a savings account that pays an annual interest rate of 3 % . How much simple interest would you earn in 2 years , in dollars ?","To calculate the simple interest earned in 2 years, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest (SI>>) = <<SI>>) = Principal (<<P>> Principal (<<P) * Rate (<<R>>) * Time (<<T>>)

Where:
- <<P>> is the principal amount (initial deposit),
- <<R>> is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- <<T>> is the time in years.

In this case:
- P>> = <<P>> = <<70>> <<70 dollars
- R>> = <<R>> = <<3\%>> <<3\%, which is equivalent to <<0.03>> in decimal form

For how much should the dealer sell the car ?,"To determine how much the dealer should sell the car for in order to make a 25% profit, we need to set up an equation. Let's denote the selling price as <<S>>.

The dealer's profit should be 25% of the selling price, which means:

Profit = 25% of <<S>>

25% can be expressed as a decimal by dividing by 100, so:

If the tables they had held 7 people each , how many tables do they need ?","To find out how many tables the company needs for the luncheon, we can start by calculating the total number of people who actually attended the luncheon, and then divide that number by the number of people each table can hold.

1. First, we know that the company initially invited 24 people.
2. However, 10 people didn't show up, so we need to subtract those who didn't attend from the initial number.
3. The number of people who attended the luncheon is 24 - 10.

Let's calculate that:

24 - 10 = <<24 - 10 = 14>> 14

Now, we need to determine how many tables are needed. Since each table can hold 7 people, we can find the number of tables by dividing the total number of people who attended by the number of people each table can hold:

c147 = <<c147 = 2>> 2

So, the company needs 2 tables for the luncheon.

Nancy uploaded 41 pictures to Facebook . She put 37 pics into one album and put the rest into 2 different albums . How many pictures were in each album ?,"Nancy uploaded a total of 41 pictures to Facebook. She put 37 pictures into one album and the rest into 2 different albums. Let's find out how many pictures were in each of the two different albums.

To do this, we can set up an equation. Let's represent the number of pictures in one of the two different albums as ""x.""

So, the number of pictures in the first album is 37, and the number of pictures in the two different albums combined is 41. Therefore, we can write the equation:

37 + x + x = <<37 + x + x = 41>> 41

Now, we can solve for ""x."" First, simplify the equation:

37 + 2x = <<37 + 2x = 41>> 41

Next, subtract 37 from both sides of the equation to isolate 2x:

2x = <<2x = 41 - 37>> 41 - 37

2x = <<2x = 4>> 4

Now, divide both sides by 2 to find the value of ""x"":

x = <<x = 4 / 2>> 4 / 2

x = <<x = 2>> 2

So, there were 2 pictures in each of the two different albums.

"Luke was organizing his baseball cards in a binder with 3 on each page . If he had 3 new cards and 9 old cards to put in the binder , how many pages would he use ?","Luke is organizing his baseball cards with 3 cards on each page. He has 3 new cards and 9 old cards to put in the binder. 

To find out how many pages he would use, we can calculate the total number of cards and then divide it by the number of cards on each page.

Total number of cards = 3 new cards + 9 old cards
Total number of cards = 3 + 9

Now, we can calculate the total number of pages Luke would use by dividing the total number of cards by 3 (since there are 3 cards on each page).

Total number of pages = Total number of cards / 3

Total number of pages = (3 + 9) / 3

If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another , how many trips will he make ?","To find out how many trips Dave will make to pick up all the trays, we can set up a division problem. We'll divide the total number of trays he needs to pick up by the number of trays he can carry in one trip (9 trays). This will give us the number of trips he needs to make.

Number of trays Dave needs to pick up = 17 trays (from one table) + 55 trays (from another table)

Number of trays Dave can carry in one trip = 9 trays

Now, let's calculate the total number of trips Dave needs to make:

Total \, trips = <<Total \, trips = c17 \, trays + 55 \, trays9 \, trays>> c17 \, trays + 55 \, trays9 \, trays
Total \, trips = <<Total \, trips = c72 \, trays9 \, trays>> c72 \, trays9 \, trays

How many pitchers of lemonade did Jonah pour in all ?","To find out how many pitchers of lemonade Jonah poured in total, we need to add up the amount he served during each of the three intermissions. 

First, let's express the amounts served during each intermission as fractions to make it easier to add them up.

1. First intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.
2. Second intermission: Jonah served 0.4166666666666667 pitcher.

Now, let's simplify the fraction in the second intermission.

2. Second intermission (simplified): Jonah served 5/12 pitcher.
3. Third intermission: Jonah served 0.25 pitcher.

Now, we can add these fractions to find the total amount of lemonade Jonah served:

0.25 (first intermission) + 5/12 (second intermission) + 0.25 (third intermission) = 0.25 + 5/12 + 0.25

To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which in this case is 12:

0.25 = 3/12 (since 0.25 is equivalent to 3/12)

Now we can add the fractions:

3/12 + 5/12 + 3/12 = 11/12

So, Jonah served a total of 11/12 pitchers of lemonade during the three intermissions.

 9 (cost per deck) * 4 (decks his friend bought) = << 9 (cost per deck) * 4 (decks his friend bought) = 36 >> 36  dollars

Now, we add their totals together to find the total amount spent:

 36 (Edward) + 36 (friend) = << 36 (Edward) + 36 (friend) = 72 >> 72  dollars

So, Edward and his friend spent a total of $72 on 4 decks each.

"At a restaurant each adult meal costs 5 and kids eat free . If a group of 15 people came in and 8 were kids , how much would it cost for the group to eat ?","To calculate the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, we need to consider the number of adults and kids and the cost of their meals.

1. Cost per adult meal: <<5
2. Number of adults: 15 people - 8 kids = 7 adults

Now, we can calculate the cost for the adults' meals:

Cost for adults = Cost per adult meal * Number of adults
Cost for adults = >>5 * 7

3. Next, we need to calculate the cost for the kids' meals. As stated in the question, kids eat for free, so the cost for the kids is <<0.

4. To find the total cost for the group, we need to add the cost for adults and the cost for kids:

Total cost = Cost for adults + Cost for kids
Total cost = (>>5 * 7) + (<<0 * 8)

5. Now, let's calculate the total cost:

Total cost = >>35 + <<0

Bryan has 50 skittles . Ben has 20 M & M ’ s . Who has more ? How many more does he have ?,"To determine who has more candies and how many more candies one has than the other, we need to compare the total number of candies Bryan has to the total number of candies Ben has.

Bryan has 50 skittles, and Ben has 20 M&M's. To compare them, we should convert the M&M's to skittles to have a common unit (skittles).

1 M&M = 2.5 skittles (since 20 M&M's * 2.5 = 50 skittles)

Now, we can compare the total number of skittles each person has:

Bryan: 50 skittles
Ben: 20 M&M's = 20 * 2.5 skittles = 50 skittles

Both Bryan and Ben have the same number of candies, which is 50 skittles each.

To find out how many more candies one has than the other, we subtract one person's count from the other:

Bryan's count - Ben's count = 50 skittles - 50 skittles = 0 skittles

So, neither Bryan nor Ben has more candies, and they both have the same number of candies, which is 50 skittles each.

Lizette has 813 stamps . Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva . How many stamps does Minerva have ?,"Let's assume that Minerva has x stamps.
According to the given information, Lizette has 125 more stamps than Minerva. So, Lizette has x + 125 stamps.
We also know that Lizette has a total of 813 stamps.
Therefore, we can set up the equation: x + 125 = 813.
To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
Subtracting 125 from both sides of the equation, we get: x = 813 - 125.

The rate for the first minute is given as 0.4698. To find the cost for the first minute, we multiply this rate by 1 (since it's only one minute):
 0.4698 * 1 = << 0.4698 * 1 = 0.4698 >> 0.4698 

The rate for additional minutes is given as 0.374. To find the cost for additional minutes, we multiply this rate by the total number of additional minutes, which is obtained by subtracting 1 from the total number of minutes:

Jacqueline has 4 boxes of erasers . Each box holds 10 erasers and there are 9 boxes in a case . How many erasers does Jacqueline have ?,"To find out how many erasers Jacqueline has, we can break this problem down step by step.

Step 1: Determine how many erasers are in a case.
Each case has 9 boxes, and each box holds 10 erasers, so to find the number of erasers in a case, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of erasers in each box:

 9 * 10 = << 9 * 10 = 90 >> 90 

Step 2: Find out how many cases Jacqueline has.
Jacqueline has 4 boxes of erasers. We need to find out how many cases that is. Since there are 9 boxes in a case, we can divide the number of boxes Jacqueline has by the number of boxes in a case to find out how many cases she has:

 4 / 9 = << 4 / 9 = 0.4444... >> 0.4444... 

Since we can't have a fraction of a case, we need to round down to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a case. Therefore, Jacqueline has 0 cases.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of erasers Jacqueline has.
Now that we know Jacqueline has 0 cases, we can calculate the total number of erasers she has by multiplying the number of cases by the number of erasers in each case (which we found in Step 1):

David had 4000 dollars invested for 0.25 of a year at a simple rate of 6 % . How much interest did he earn ?,"To calculate the interest David earned, we can use the formula for simple interest:

Simple Interest = Principal (P) x Rate (R) x Time (T)

Where:
- P is the principal amount (initial investment)
- R is the annual interest rate (in decimal form)
- T is the time the money is invested (in years)

In this case, David had <<4,000 invested at a rate of 6% for 0.25 of a year. We need to convert the interest rate from a percentage to a decimal by dividing it by 100:

R = 6% = 0.06

T = 0.25 year

Now, we can calculate the interest:

Simple Interest = >>4000 x 0.06 x 0.25

Now, perform the calculations step by step:

"A ship full of grain crashes into a coral reef . By the time the ship is fixed , 49952 tons of grain have spilled into the water . Only 918 tons of grain remain onboard . How many tons of grain did the ship originally contain ?","To find out how many tons of grain the ship originally contained, we can set up an equation. Let ""x"" represent the original amount of grain on the ship. 

The situation can be summarized with the following equation:
\[ x - 49952 = 918 \]

Now, we need to solve for ""x"" by isolating it on one side of the equation. To do that, we'll add 49952 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -49952 on the left side:

\[ x - 49952 + 49952 = 918 + 49952 \]

Simplifying both sides:

\[ x = 50870 \]

So, the ship originally contained 50,870 tons of grain.

"Harry Hound had a terrible earache yesterday . When I peered into his ears yesterday , I found 36 frisky fleas having a party in his right ear and 85 baby fleas sleeping peacefully in his left ear . I cleaned out Harry Hound 's ears . How many fleas perished ?","To find out how many fleas perished, we need to calculate the total number of fleas that were in Harry Hound's ears and subtract the number of baby fleas that were sleeping peacefully in his left ear.

Step 1: Find the total number of fleas.
Total fleas = Number of fleas in the right ear + Number of fleas in the left ear
Total fleas = 36 (in the right ear) + 85 (in the left ear)

Total fleas = 36 + 85 = 121

Step 2: Subtract the number of baby fleas in the left ear.
Number of baby fleas that were in the left ear = 85

John can read 4 books a day . John reads every Monday and Tuesday . How many books would John read in 6 weeks ?,"To find out how many books John would read in 6 weeks, we need to calculate the number of books he reads in a day and then multiply that by the number of days in 6 weeks. Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. John can read 4 books a day.
2. John reads every Monday and Tuesday, so he reads on 2 days each week.
3. There are 6 weeks in total.
4. To find the total number of books John would read in 6 weeks, we calculate the number of days he reads in 6 weeks and then multiply it by the number of books he reads in a day.

Given:
Cost for 75 pounds of apples = <<3

We want to find the cost for 3 pounds of apples.

Let's set up the proportion:

>>3 / 75 pounds = Cost for 3 pounds / 3 pounds

Now, we can solve for the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" using cross-multiplication:

3 * 3 pounds = <<3 * 3 pounds = >> 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

9 pounds = 75 * Cost for 3 pounds

To find the cost for 3 pounds of apples, we need to isolate the ""Cost for 3 pounds"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides by 75:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 pounds) / 75

Now, we can calculate the cost for 3 pounds of apples:

Cost for 3 pounds = 9 / 75

Simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:

Cost for 3 pounds = (9 / 3) / (75 / 3)

Cost for 3 pounds = 3 / 25

So, the cost for 3 pounds of apples at the same rate is $3/25.

We know that Emily scored 23 points and everyone else scored 2 points each. If there were <<x>> players on Emily's team, then the total points scored by everyone else would be <<(x-1) * 2>>, since Emily is not included in the everyone else category. 

The total points scored by Emily and everyone else is given as 39. So we can write the equation:

23 + (x-1) * 2 = <<23 + (x-1) * 2 = 39>> 39

Simplifying the equation:

23 + 2(x-1) = <<23 + 2(x-1) = 39>> 39

23 + 2x - 2 = <<23 + 2x - 2 = 39>> 39

At what rate , in clients per hour , are the new clients being acquired when both are working ?","To find the rate at which new clients are being acquired when both brokers are working, we need to add up their individual rates.

1. The first broker is able to get a new client every 0.125 hour, which is equivalent to <<1>> new client every <<1 / 0.125}>> hour.
   So, the first broker's rate is <<1 / 0.125}>> clients per hour.

2. The second broker is able to get a new client every 0.2 hour, which is equivalent to <<1>> new client every <<1 / 0.2}>> hour.
   So, the second broker's rate is <<1 / 0.2}>> clients per hour.

Now, we can find the combined rate when both brokers are working by adding their rates together.

Combined rate = <<= 1 / 0.125} + 1 / 0.2}>> 1 / 0.125} + 1 / 0.2} clients per hour

We can express this problem as a subtraction:

50 - tGames Given Away = <<50 - tGames Given Away = 35>> 35

Now, let's solve for the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

50 - tGames Given Away = <<50 - tGames Given Away = 35>> 35

Subtract 35 from both sides:

50 - 35 = <<50 - 35 = 35 - tGames Given Away>> 35 - tGames Given Away

15 = <<15 = 35 - tGames Given Away>> 35 - tGames Given Away

Now, to isolate the variable ""Games Given Away,"" we can subtract 35 from both sides:

15 - 35 = <<15 - 35 = 35 - 35 - tGames Given Away>> 35 - 35 - tGames Given Away

-20 = <<-20 = -tGames Given Away>> -tGames Given Away

Finally, we can multiply both sides by -1 to find the number of games Kelly needs to give away:

"Tommy had some balloons . His mom gave him 34 more balloons for his birthday . Then , Tommy had 60 balloons . How many balloons did Tommy have to start with ?","Let's use the information provided in the question to solve for the number of balloons Tommy had to start with step by step.

1. Tommy had some balloons, so let's represent the number of balloons he initially had with a variable, say ""B.""

2. Tommy's mom gave him 34 more balloons for his birthday. So, we can represent this as an addition: B + 34.

3. After receiving these additional balloons, Tommy had 60 balloons in total. We can represent this as an equation: B + 34 = 60.

Now, to find out how many balloons Tommy had to start with (the value of B), we need to isolate B by subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation:

B + 34 - 34 = 60 - 34.

This simplifies to:

B = 26.

Gumballs come in packages of 5 . Nathan ate 20 gumballs . How many whole boxes did he eat and how many gumballs does he have left ?,"To solve this problem, we need to find out how many whole boxes of gumballs Nathan ate and how many gumballs he has left after eating 20 gumballs.

Step 1: Determine how many whole boxes Nathan ate:
Nathan ate 20 gumballs, and each box contains 5 gumballs, so we can find the number of whole boxes he ate by dividing the total number of gumballs he ate by the number of gumballs per box:
 20 / 5 = << 20 / 5 = 4 >> 4  whole boxes.

Step 2: Calculate how many gumballs he has left:
To find out how many gumballs Nathan has left, we need to subtract the gumballs he ate from the total number of gumballs:
 Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = << Total\,gumballs - Gumballs\,ate = Total\,gumballs - 20 >> Total\,gumballs - 20 

Step 3: Calculate the number of gumballs Nathan has left:
If we assume that Nathan started with a certain number of gumballs, let's call it ""X,"" then we can express the equation as:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs >> Left\,gumballs 

Step 4: Calculate the total number of gumballs in a box and the total number of gumballs Nathan has left:
Each box contains 5 gumballs, and Nathan ate 4 whole boxes, so we can calculate the total number of gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate:
 4 * 5 = << 4 * 5 = 20 >> 20  gumballs in the boxes Nathan ate.

Step 5: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now, we can use the equation from step 3 to calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs >> Left\,gumballs 

Step 6: Find the value of X (the total number of gumballs Nathan started with):
 X = << X = Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 >> Total\,gumballs + 20 = 20 + 20 = 40 

So, Nathan started with 40 gumballs.

Step 7: Calculate how many gumballs Nathan has left:
Now that we know he started with 40 gumballs, we can use the equation from step 5 to find out how many gumballs he has left:
 X - 20 = << X - 20 = Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 >> Left\,gumballs = 40 - 20 = 20 

Nathan has 20 gumballs left.

The answer is:
Nathan ate 4 whole boxes of gumballs, and he has 20 gumballs left.

A man starts walking for the first week and walks 10 miles . Every week he increases the distance by 2 miles . How many miles does he walk by the 8th week ?,"The man starts walking 10 miles in the first week and then increases the distance by 2 miles every week. So, in the second week, he walks 10 + 2 miles, in the third week, he walks 10 + 2 + 2 miles, and so on. This is an arithmetic sequence.

To find how many miles he walks by the 8th week, we can calculate the sum of the first 8 terms of this arithmetic sequence.

The formula to find the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is:

Sum = (n/2) * [2 * a + (n - 1) * d]

Where:
- Sum is the sum of the first n terms.
- n is the number of terms.
- a is the first term.
- d is the common difference between the terms.

In this case, the first term (a) is 10 miles, the common difference (d) is 2 miles, and we want to find the sum of the first 8 terms (n = 8).

Let's plug these values into the formula:

Sum = (8/2) * [2 * 10 + (8 - 1) * 2]

Sum = 4 * [20 + 7 * 2]

Now, calculate the expression inside the brackets:

Sum = 4 * (20 + 14)

Sum = 4 * 34

George had 30 dollars . For his birthday he got 16 more dollars but spent 38 on a new game . How much money does he have now ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. George starts with <<30.
2. He receives an additional >>16 for his birthday.
3. He spends <<38 on a new game.

Now, let's calculate how much money he has left.

Starting amount: >>30
Birthday gift: <<16

"A pet shelter had 17 puppies when another 55 were brought in . If 8 puppies a day are adopted , how long would it take for all of them to be adopted ?","Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. The pet shelter initially had 17 puppies.
2. Another 55 puppies were brought in, so now they have a total of 17 + 55 puppies.
3. Every day, 8 puppies are adopted.

To find out how long it would take for all the puppies to be adopted, we can set up an equation. We need to find the number of days it takes for the total number of puppies to reach zero.

Starting with the total number of puppies:
Total = <<Total = 17 + 55>> 17 + 55

Now, we need to find out how many days it would take for all the puppies to be adopted. Let's call this ""d"" (the number of days).

Each day, 8 puppies are adopted, so we can subtract 8 for each day:
Total - 8d = <<Total - 8d = 0>> 0

Now, we can solve for ""d"" to find out how many days it takes for all the puppies to be adopted:
17 + 55 - 8d = <<17 + 55 - 8d = 0>> 0

72 - 8d = <<72 - 8d = 0>> 0

8d = <<8d = 72>> 72

To isolate ""d,"" we can divide both sides by 8:
d = <<d = 7 / 28>> 7 / 28

d = <<d = 9>> 9

So, it would take 9 days for all the puppies to be adopted.

"After the price of petroleum oil went up by 10 % , a consumer reduced his oil consumption by the same percent . By what percent would his petroleum bill be changed ?","To find the percent change in the consumer's petroleum bill after the price of petroleum oil went up by 10% and the consumer reduced their oil consumption by the same percent, we can use the following steps:

1. Let's assume the original price of petroleum oil is <<100, and the original oil consumption is 100 units for simplicity. This is just an arbitrary choice to make the calculations easier.

2. After the price of petroleum oil went up by 10%, the new price is >>110 (<<100 + 10% of >>100).

3. The consumer reduces oil consumption by 10%, which means they now consume 90 units of oil (100 units - 10% of 100 units).

4. To calculate the new petroleum bill, we multiply the new price by the new consumption: 110 * 90 = <<110 * 90 = >> 9900.

5. Now, let's calculate the percent change in the petroleum bill. We'll compare the new bill of <<9900 to the original bill of >>10000.

Percent Change = ((New Value - Original Value) / Original Value) * 100
Percent Change = ((<<9900 - >>10000) / <<10000) * 100

Now, let's calculate the percent change:

Percent Change = ((>>9900 - 10000) / >>10000) * 100 = <<10000) / >>10000) * 100 = (-<<100 / >> (-<<100 / 10000) * 100 = -1%

So, the consumer's petroleum bill would be changed by a decrease of 1%.

michael has some fish in his fish tank . ben gave him 18 more fish . now he has 49 how many fish did he have to begin with ?,"Let's use a mathematical approach to solve this problem step by step:

1. Michael initially had some fish in his fish tank, and we want to find out how many fish he had. Let's represent this unknown quantity as ""x.""

2. Ben gave him 18 more fish, so the total number of fish after receiving Ben's fish can be represented as ""x + 18.""

3. Now, we know that after receiving Ben's fish, Michael has a total of 49 fish. So, we can set up the following equation:
    x + 18 = << x + 18 = 49 >> 49 

4. To find the initial number of fish Michael had, we need to isolate ""x"" on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:
    x + 18 - 18 = << x + 18 - 18 = 49 - 18 >> 49 - 18 

5. Simplifying the equation:
    x = << x = 31 >> 31

tommy had some balloons . his mom gave him 34 more balloons for his birthday . then tommy had 60 balloons . how many balloons did tommy have to start with ?,"Let's set up an equation to solve this problem step by step.

Tommy initially had some balloons, which we don't know, so we'll represent that with the variable <<x>>. Then his mom gave him 34 more balloons, so the total number of balloons he had after his birthday is <<x + 34>>. We know that after the birthday, he had 60 balloons, so we can write the equation:

 x + 34 = << x + 34 = 60 >> 60 

Now, let's solve for <<x by isolating it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 34 from both sides of the equation:

>> x + 34 - 34 = 60 - 34 <<

This simplifies to:

>> x = 26 $

Alex used 32 candles, so that means he has C - 32 candles left. We're given that he now has 12 candles left, so we can write the equation as:

C - 32 = 12

To find out how many candles Alex had to start with, we need to isolate C on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 32 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -32 on the left side:

C - 32 + 32 = 12 + 32

This simplifies to:

C = 44

So, Alex had 44 candles to start with. ####

George has 5 boxes of eggs . Each box holds 3 eggs and there are 9 boxes in a case . How many eggs does George have ?,"To find out how many eggs George has, we can break down the problem into steps:

1. First, we need to calculate how many boxes George has. George has 5 boxes of eggs.

<<5>> boxes

2. Next, we need to find out how many eggs are in each box. Each box holds 3 eggs.

Each box holds <<3>> eggs

3. Now, let's calculate how many eggs George has in total by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of eggs in each box.

5>> boxes * Each box holds <<3>> eggs = <<5>> boxes * Each box holds <<3>> eggs = <<15>> <<15 eggs

4. Finally, we need to account for the fact that there are 9 boxes in a case. To find out how many cases George has, we can divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes in a case.

5>> boxes / 9 boxes in a case = <<5>> boxes / 9 boxes in a case = <<0.5555...>> <<0.5555...

However, since we can't have a fraction of a case, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, as it wouldn't make sense to have a fraction of a case in this context.

So, George has <<0>> cases.

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs George has:

George has 0>> cases * 9 boxes in a case = <<0>> cases * 9 boxes in a case = <<0>> <<0 boxes

5. Finally, to find out how many eggs George has in total, we can multiply the number of cases by the number of eggs in each case.

0>> cases * Each case holds <<15>> eggs = <<0>> cases * Each case holds <<15>> eggs = <<0>> <<0 eggs

So, George has a total of 0 eggs.

"The school cafeteria ordered 33 red apples and 23 green apples for students lunches . But , if only 21 students wanted fruit , how many extra did the cafeteria end up with ?","To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with, we first need to determine the total number of apples they ordered and then subtract the number of apples the 21 students wanted. 

1. Total red apples ordered: 33
2. Total green apples ordered: 23
3. Total apples ordered (red + green): <<33 + 23>>

Now, we can find the total number of apples the cafeteria ordered.

4. Total apples ordered: <<33 + 23>>

Next, we'll subtract the number of apples the 21 students wanted:

5. Number of apples for 21 students: 21

To find out how many extra apples the cafeteria ended up with:

6. Extra apples = Total apples ordered - Number of apples for 21 students
7. Extra apples = <<(33 + 23) - 21>>

Now, we can calculate the number of extra apples:

8. Extra apples = <<33 + 23 - 21>>

Perform the subtraction:

9. Extra apples = <<55 - 21>>

Finally, calculate the number of extra apples:

10. Extra apples = <<34>>

So, the cafeteria ended up with 34 extra apples.####

Let's break it down step by step:

1. First, calculate the total number of cards John has: 
   New cards + Old cards = 8 + 16 = 24 cards.

2. Next, determine how many pages he would need. Each page holds 3 cards, so we can use division to find the number of pages:

The problem states that Janine needs to make 750 mini meat pies for the mayor's party. 

The first team made << 235 >> pies and the second team made << 275 >> pies.

Since Janine needs a total of 750 pies and the first two teams made a total of  235 + 275 = << 235 + 275 = 510 >> 510  pies, the third team needs to make:

The problem states that the total amount of soup needed is 280 cups. The first team made 90 cups and the third team made 70 cups. Therefore, the amount of soup the second team needs to make can be calculated as:

280 - (90 + 70) = <<280 - (90 + 70) =>>

280 - 160 = <<280 - 160 =>>

<<120>> cups

However, the problem asks how many *more* cups the second team needs to make compared to the other teams. Since the first team made 90 cups and the third team made 70 cups, we add those amounts:

90 + 70 = <<90 + 70 =>>

<<160>> cups 

Subtracting 160 cups from the total needed (280 cups) gives the amount the second team still needs to make:

280 - 160 = <<280 - 160 =>>

<<140>> cups

Therefore, the second team needs to make <<140>> cups of mushroom soup in order to meet the required amount.

We know that the first team made 189 pieces and the second team made 131 pieces. To find out how many pieces the third team should make, we need to subtract the combined pieces made by the first and second teams from the target of 500 pieces.

So, let's start by adding the pieces made by the first and second teams: 189 + 131 = <<189 + 131 = 320>> 320.

Now, we can find out how many pieces the third team should make by subtracting the total pieces made by the first and second teams from the target of 500 pieces: 500 - 320 = <<500 - 320 = 180>> 180.

The total number of nails he already has is 247 nails.

He found another 144 nails in his toolshed.

So the total number of nails he currently has is 247 + 144 = <<247 + 144 = 391>> 391 nails.

He needs a total of 500 nails.

To find out how many more nails he needs to buy, we subtract the total number of nails he currently has from the total number of nails he needs.

The question states that he bought 215 lbs of cement and his son brought 137 lbs of cement. In total, they now have 450 lbs of cement. We need to find how much cement he originally had.

 215 + 137 = << 215 + 137 = 352 >> 352 

He bought 215 lbs and his son brought 137 lbs, so together they brought 352 lbs of cement. 

 450 - 352 = << 450 - 352 = 98 >> 98 

They now have 450 lbs of cement and they brought 352 lbs, so the difference is 450 - 352 = 98 lbs.

So the amount of cement he originally had is 98 lbs.

Given that each section of the orchard produces 45 sacks of apples daily, and there are 8 sections in total, we can calculate the total number of sacks harvested each day by multiplying the number of sacks per section by the number of sections.

Number of sacks per section = 45
Number of sections = 8

Total number of sacks harvested daily = Number of sacks per section * Number of sections

Total number of sacks harvested daily = 45 * 8

Next, we need to calculate the number of apples in each sack. Since the question does not provide this information, we will assume a value for the number of apples in each sack. Let's assume there are 50 apples in each sack.

Number of apples in each sack = 50

To find the total number of apples harvested daily, we need to multiply the total number of sacks harvested daily by the number of apples in each sack.

Total number of apples harvested daily = Total number of sacks harvested daily * Number of apples in each sack

Total number of apples harvested daily = (45 * 8) * 50

Now we can calculate the total number of apples harvested every day.

a worm has fallen into a hole that is 26 inches deep . it climbs up 8 inches and slides back 3 inches every day . how many days will it take the worm to reach the top ?," Here is my step by step solution for the given math problem:

The worm starts at 26 inches deep in the hole.
Every day, it climbs up 8 inches but then slides back 3 inches.  
So on the first day, it climbs up 8 inches to 18 inches deep.   
Then it slides back 3 inches to 21 inches deep.    
On the second day, it again climbs up 8 inches to 13 inches deep.  
Then it slides back 3 inches to 16 inches deep.
We need to find how many days it takes for the worm to reach the surface at 0 inches deep.
Let's call the number of days <<n>>.   
The pattern is:    
The worm climbs 8 inches and then slides back 3 inches every day.
So on day <<n>>, the worm will climb <<8n>> inches total and slide back <<3n>> inches.
Since it needs to reach 0 inches deep, we can set up an equation:
26 - (8n - 3n) = <<26 - (8n - 3n) = 0>> 0
Solving for <<n>>:
26 - 5n = <<26 - 5n = 0>> 0
5n = <<5n = 26>> 26
n = <<n = 26/5>> 26/5

maura collects seashells every summer . her family stays at the beach house for 21 days . this summer maura found 75 seashells . she gave some to her little sister . maura then had 57 seashells . how many seashells did maura give to her sister ?,"Let's denote the number of seashells Maura gave to her sister as ""x"". 

We know that Maura found 75 seashells initially and gave some to her sister. After giving some to her sister, she had 57 seashells left. 

So, we can write the equation: 75 - x = 57.

To find the value of ""x"", we can solve this equation.

Starting with 75, subtracting x from both sides of the equation gives us: 75 - x - x = 57 - x.

Simplifying the equation gives us: 75 - 2x = 57.

To isolate the variable, we subtract 75 from both sides of the equation: 75 - 2x - 75 = 57 - 75.

Simplifying the equation gives us: -2x = -18.

Finally, to solve for ""x"", we divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2x) / -2 = (-18) / -2.

Simplifying the equation gives us: x = 9.

Therefore, Maura gave 9 seashells to her sister.

the central city zoo has 45 chimpanzees . every day the chimps eat a total of 72 bananas . next week the zoo is moving 18 chimps to a new cage . how many chimps will stay in the old cage ?,"Let's start by finding out how many bananas each chimp eats per day. To do this, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of chimps.

Total bananas per day = 72
Number of chimps = 45

So, bananas per chimp per day = Total bananas per day / Number of chimps

Bananas per chimp per day = 72 / 45 = 1.6 bananas

Next, let's find out how many bananas the 18 chimps that are being moved eat per day. We can do this by multiplying the number of bananas per chimp per day by the number of chimps being moved.

Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas
Number of chimps being moved = 18

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = Bananas per chimp per day * Number of chimps being moved

Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 1.6 * 18 = 28.8 bananas

Now, let's find out how many bananas the remaining chimps in the old cage eat per day. We can do this by subtracting the bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day from the total bananas per day.

Total bananas per day = 72 bananas
Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day = 28.8 bananas

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = Total bananas per day - Bananas eaten by the chimps being moved per day

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 72 - 28.8 = 43.2 bananas

Since each chimp eats 1.6 bananas per day, we can find out how many chimps will stay in the old cage by dividing the bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day by the number of bananas per chimp per day.

Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day = 43.2 bananas
Bananas per chimp per day = 1.6 bananas

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = Bananas eaten by the remaining chimps per day / Bananas per chimp per day

Number of chimps staying in the old cage = 43.2 / 1.6 = 27

Therefore, 27 chimps will stay in the old cage.####

jake read 37 pages of his new book . it has 8 chapters and 95 pages . jake read 25 more pages later that day . how many pages has he read in all ?,"To find the total number of pages Jake has read, we need to add the number of pages he initially read to the number of pages he read later that day.

Jake initially read 37 pages of his new book, which has a total of 95 pages. So, we can represent this as <<37 + 95>>.

Jake also read 25 more pages later that day. So, we need to add this to the previous sum. We can represent this as <<(37 + 95) + 25>>.

Calculating this expression, we have (37 + 95) + 25 = <<(37 + 95) + 25 = 132 + 25>> 132 + 25.

Performing the addition, we get <<157>>.

Greg has 14 more marbles than Adam, so we need to add 14 to Adam's number of marbles.
Greg has 29 + 14 = 43 marbles.

Therefore, Greg has 43 marbles.

This means she has a total of 28 + 32 = 60 pictures available to take.

Zoe then took 16 more pictures at the dolphin show. To find out how many pictures Zoe has taken altogether, we need to add the number of pictures she had before the dolphin show (60) to the number of pictures she took at the dolphin show (16).

So Zoe has taken a total of 60 + 16 = 76 pictures altogether.

Anthony gets 75 cents every day for lunch and he spent 27 cents on a juice box. So, the remaining amount after buying the juice box is given by 75 - 27 = <<75 - 27 = 48>> 48 cents. 

Anthony had 8 cents left after buying the cupcake. We can represent this as 48 - c = <<48 - c = 8>> 8. 

To find the cost of the cupcake, we can solve the equation 48 - c = <<48 - c = 8>> 8 for <<c>>. 

Subtracting 48 from both sides of the equation, we have 48 - 48 - c = <<48 - 48 - c = 8 - 48>> 8 - 48. Simplifying, we get -c = <<-c = -40>> -40. 

To solve for c>>, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1, giving us <<c = <<c>>, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1, giving us <<c = 40>> 40.

We know that Kevin collected 14 stuffed animals and 18 frisbees, which gives us a total of <<14 + 18 = <<y>>. We know that Kevin collected 14 stuffed animals and 18 frisbees, which gives us a total of <<14 + 18 = 32>> 32 toys collected. 

Adding the number of yo-yos collected, which is <<y>>, to the total number of toys collected should give us the total number of prizes Kevin has, which is 50. 

So the equation representing this situation is 32 + y = <<32 + y = 50>> 50. 

To find the value of <<y>>, we can subtract 32 from both sides of the equation: 

32 + y - 32 = <<32 + y - 32 = 50 - 32>> 50 - 32

This simplifies to:

To find the number of necklaces Charlene had left:
60 - 16 (sold) - 18 (given) = 

Performing the arithmetic operations:
60 - 16 - 18 = 

Then, 
60 - 16 - 18 = 26

scott and sam decided to sell their old comic books . they had 90 comic books altogether . after the sale they only had 25 comic books . how many comic books did scott and sam sell ?,"Let's denote the number of comic books Scott sold as <<x>>, and the number of comic books Sam sold as <<y>>. We are given that the total number of comic books they had is 90, and after the sale, they had 25 comic books remaining. 

We can write two equations based on the given information:
1. x + y = <<x + y = 90>> 90 (equation 1)
2. x + y = <<x + y = 25>> 25 (equation 2)

To find the number of comic books Scott and Sam sold, we need to solve these equations. 

First, we'll subtract equation 2 from equation 1 to eliminate the variable <<y>>:
(x + y) - (x + y) = <<(x + y) - (x + y) = 90 - 25>> 90 - 25

Simplifying the equation:
0 = <<0 = 65>> 65

This equation is not possible since the left side is 0 and the right side is 65. 

Therefore, there must be an error in the given information or the problem statement. It is not possible to determine how many comic books Scott and Sam sold based on the given information.

First, we can find out how many red roses Melanie started with. We know there were initially 8 red roses, and we have 14 red roses now, so:

 14 - 8 = << 14 - 8 = 6 >> 6 

Melanie started with 6 red roses. Now, let's find out how many red roses she cut:

 6 - 8 = << 6 - 8 = -2 >> -2 

Melanie cut -2 red roses. Since we can't have a negative number of roses, it means Melanie didn't cut any red roses. So, the answer is 0.

jason had 27 peaches and 17 pears left at his roadside fruit stand . he went to the orchard and picked more peaches to stock up the stand . there are now 90 peaches at the stand how many did he pick ?,"Jason started with 27 peaches at his fruit stand and picked some more from the orchard. After picking, he now has 90 peaches at the stand. To find out how many peaches he picked, we need to subtract the initial number of peaches from the final number.

Let's represent the number of peaches Jason picked as ""x"". We can set up the equation:

27 (initial peaches) + x (picked peaches) = 90 (final peaches)

To solve for ""x"", we can subtract 27 from both sides of the equation:

27 + x = 90 - 27

This simplifies to:

x = 63

Therefore, Jason picked 63 peaches.

there were 47 bales of hay in the barn and 40 bales in the shed . benny stacked more bales in the barn today . there are now 82 bales of hay in the barn . how many bales did he store in the barn ?,"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 47 bales of hay in the barn.
2. There were also 40 bales in the shed.
3. Benny stacked more bales in the barn today.
4. After stacking, there are now 82 bales of hay in the barn.

To find out how many bales Benny stored in the barn today, we need to subtract the initial number of bales in the barn (47) and the bales that were already in the shed (40) from the current total in the barn (82). This will give us the number of bales Benny added.

So, the calculation is: <<82 - 47 - 40>>.

Now, let's calculate that:

82 - 47 - 40 = <<82 - 47 - 40 = 82 - 87 = -5>> 82 - 87 = -5

Benny added -5 bales to the barn. Since this doesn't make sense in a real-world scenario, it's likely there's an error in the problem statement.

dan 's high school played 18 baseball games this year and 2 were at night . the team won most of their games . they were defeated during 3 games . how many games did they win ?,"Let's break down the information given in the question:

1. The high school played 18 baseball games.
2. 2 of these games were at night.
3. The team won most of their games.
4. They were defeated during 3 games.

To find out how many games the team won, we can start by calculating the total number of games they lost and the games they won.

Total Games = 18 (the number of games played)
Games at Night = 2
Games Lost = 3

To find the number of games won, we can use the fact that the team won most of their games, which implies they won more games than they lost. Since there were 18 games in total, and we know they lost 3 games and 2 games were at night, we can calculate the number of games won as follows:

Total Games - (Games Lost + Games at Night) = Games Won
18 - (3 + 2) = Games Won
18 - 5 = Games Won

Now, let's calculate the number of games won:

18 - 5 = <<18 - 5 = 13>> 13

So, the team won 13 games.

   Shorter trip = Diameter - Circumference
   Shorter trip = 2 - 6

6. Calculate the difference:
   Shorter trip = -4 miles

Chad's trip is 4 miles shorter if he canoes across the lake instead of walking around it.

 tInitial number of apples - tApples used for pie = << tInitial number of apples - tApples used for pie = tApples left >> tApples left 

Let's use this equation to solve the problem:

 tInitial number of apples - 15 = << tInitial number of apples - 15 = 4 >> 4 

Now, we can isolate the ""Initial number of apples"" by adding 15 to both sides of the equation:

 tInitial number of apples = << tInitial number of apples = 4 + 15 >> 4 + 15 

Performing the addition:

 tInitial number of apples = << tInitial number of apples = 19 >> 19 

So, the chef initially had 19 apples before making the pie.

a package had 18 cookies in it . after eating some there were 9 left . how many were eaten ?,"To find out how many cookies were eaten, we can set up a simple equation. Let's call the number of cookies eaten ""x.""

The total number of cookies in the package was 18, and after eating some, there were 9 left. So, we can express this as an equation:

18 (initial total) - x (cookies eaten) = 9 (leftover cookies)

Now, let's solve for x:

18 - x = 9

To isolate x, we can subtract 18 from both sides of the equation:

- x = 9 - 18

Now, calculate the right side of the equation:

- x = -9

To find the number of cookies eaten, we need to make the value of x positive. Since it represents cookies eaten, we can take the absolute value of -9 to get the number of cookies eaten:

|-9| = 9

So, 9 cookies were eaten.

ned gave away 13 of his video games to a friend . now ned has 6 games . how many games did ned have before he gave the games away ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

Ned originally had some video games, and he gave away 13 of them to a friend. After giving away those games, he now has 6 games left.

To find out how many games Ned originally had, we can set up an equation:

Original number of games - 13 (games given away) = 6 (games left)

We need to solve for the ""Original number of games.""

Original number of games - 13 = 6

Now, to isolate the ""Original number of games"" on one side of the equation, we can add 13 to both sides:

Original number of games - 13 + 13 = 6 + 13

This simplifies to:

Original number of games = 19

So, Ned originally had 19 video games before giving 13 of them away.

at the arcade dave spent 43 tickets on stuffed tiger . then he had 55 left . how many tickets did dave have to start with ?,"To find out how many tickets Dave had to start with, we can set up an equation. Dave spent 43 tickets on a stuffed tiger and had 55 tickets left. We can represent this situation as an equation:

Dave's initial number of tickets - 43 (spent on the stuffed tiger) = 55 (left after spending).

Let's use the symbol << to denote Dave's initial number of tickets. The equation becomes:

>> - 43 = 55

To solve for <<, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 43 to both sides:

>> - 43 + 43 = 55 + 43

This simplifies to:

$ = 98

So, Dave initially had 98 tickets.

adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed . if he had 12 lawns to mow but forgot to mow 8 of them how much money did he actually earn ?,"Adam earned <<9 for each lawn he mowed, and he had 12 lawns to mow. However, he forgot to mow 8 of them. To find out how much money he actually earned, we need to calculate the amount he earned for the lawns he did mow and then subtract the amount he would have earned for the lawns he forgot to mow.

Step 1: Calculate the amount earned for the lawns he did mow.
Number of lawns mowed = 12 - 8 (lawns he forgot to mow) = 4 lawns mowed
Amount earned for the lawns mowed = 4 lawns mowed * >>9 per lawn

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned.
Amount earned = 4 lawns mowed * <<9 per lawn - amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow

Step 3: Calculate the amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow.
Amount he would have earned for the 8 lawns = 8 lawns * >>9 per lawn

Now, let's calculate the actual amount he earned.

Amount earned = (4 lawns mowed * <<9 per lawn) - (8 lawns * >>9 per lawn)

Amount earned = (<<36) - (>>72)

Amount earned = <<36 - >>72

Amount earned = <<-36

So, Adam actually earned ->>36, which means he didn't earn any money; he owes $36.

In fourth grade there were 10 students at the start of the year . During the year 4 students left and 42 new students came to school . How many students were in fourth grade at the end ?,"To find the number of students in fourth grade at the end of the year, we need to subtract the number of students who left during the year from the number of students who came to the school.

Number of students at the start of the year = 10
Number of students who left during the year = 4
Number of new students who came to the school = 42

To find the number of students at the end of the year, we can subtract the number of students who left from the number of students at the start of the year and then add the number of new students who came to the school.

Number of students at the end of the year = (Number of students at the start of the year - Number of students who left) + Number of new students who came to the school

Number of students at the end of the year = (10 - 4) + 42

Calculating the expression inside the parentheses first:
Number of students at the end of the year = 6 + 42

Adding the two numbers together:
Number of students at the end of the year = 48

Therefore, there were 48 students in fourth grade at the end of the year.

If 2 pounds of the chocolate and 55 pounds of the carob candy are used , what is the cost per pound of the mixture in dollars ?","To find the cost per pound of the mixture, we need to calculate the total cost and the total weight of the mixture. We can do this by finding the cost of the chocolate and carob separately and then adding them together. Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Cost of 2 pounds of chocolate:
   The cost of 1 pound of chocolate is <<2, so the cost of 2 pounds of chocolate is >>2 * 2 = <<4.

2. Cost of 55 pounds of carob candy:
   The cost of 1 pound of carob candy is >>7, so the cost of 55 pounds of carob candy is 7 * 55 = <<7 * 55 = >> 385.

3. Total cost of the mixture:
   The total cost of the mixture is the sum of the cost of chocolate and carob candy, so it is <<4 + >>385 = <<389.

4. Total weight of the mixture:
   The total weight of the mixture is the sum of the weight of chocolate and carob candy, so it is 2 pounds + 55 pounds = 57 pounds.

5. Cost per pound of the mixture:
   To find the cost per pound of the mixture, we divide the total cost by the total weight, so it is >>389 / 57 pounds.

Now, let's calculate the cost per pound of the mixture:

389 / 57 pounds = <<389 / 57 pounds = >> 6.82 (rounded to two decimal places)

So, the cost per pound of the mixture is $6.82.

Initial lives per player = 6 lives/player
Number of players = 8

Total initial lives = Initial lives per player * Number of players

Total initial lives = <<6 * 8>>

Now, we need to calculate the number of lives the 2 new players brought to the game.

Lives per new player = 6 lives/player
Number of new players = 2

Total lives from new players = Lives per new player * Number of new players

Total lives from new players = <<6 * 2>>

Now, we'll find the total number of lives after the 2 new players joined the game by adding the total initial lives and the total lives from new players.

Total lives after new players joined = Total initial lives + Total lives from new players

Total lives after new players joined = <<6 * 8 + 6 * 2>>

Now, let's simplify this expression step by step:

Total lives after new players joined = <<48 + 12>>

Now, perform the addition:

Total lives after new players joined = $60

Luke won 2 tickets playing 'whack a mole' and 13 tickets playing 'skee ball'. To find the total number of tickets he has:

Total tickets = 2 (from 'whack a mole') + 13 (from 'skee ball') = 15 tickets.

Now, we need to find out how many candies Luke can buy. Since each candy costs 3 tickets, we can use division to calculate the number of candies:

The total weight of the books can be calculated by multiplying the number of books by the weight of each book:

<<B * 3>> pounds

According to the problem, the total weight of the box of books is 42 pounds. Therefore, we can set up an equation:

B * 3 = <<B * 3 = 42>> 42

To solve for <<B>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3:

To figure out how many cages they used, we need to know how many puppies fit in each cage. The problem states that <<6>> puppies fit in each cage.

Since <<54>> puppies remained and <<6>> fit in each cage, we can divide <<54>> puppies by <<6>> puppies per cage to find the number of cages needed:

54 / 6 = <<54 / 6 = 9>> 9

But the problem asks for the number of cages used, not remaining. Since <<34>> puppies were sold, those puppies also needed cages. So we add the number of cages for the puppies sold:

mrs. hilt went to a concert . a total of 65899 people attended the concert . the next week she went to a second concert which had 119 more people in attendance . how many people were at the second concert ?,"Mrs. Hilt attended two concerts, and we need to find the number of people at the second concert.

Let's denote the number of people at the first concert as <<F>> and the number of people at the second concert as <<S>>. We know that the total number of people who attended both concerts is 65,899.

So, we can write the equation:
F + S = <<F + S = 65,899>> 65,899

We also know that the second concert had 119 more people in attendance than the first concert, so we can write another equation:
S = <<S = F + 119>> F + 119

Now we can use these two equations to solve for the number of people at the second concert. First, we'll substitute the second equation into the first one:

F + (F + 119) = <<F + (F + 119) = 65,899>> 65,899

Now, we can combine the terms:

2F + 119 = <<2F + 119 = 65,899>> 65,899

Subtract 119 from both sides to isolate 2F:

2F = <<2F = 65,899 - 119>> 65,899 - 119

2F = <<2F = 65,780>> 65,780

Now, divide by 2 to find the number of people at the first concert, F:

F = <<F = 6 / 5,780}2>> 6 / 5,780}2

Now, calculate F:

F = <<F = 32,890>> 32,890

So, there were 32,890 people at the first concert. To find the number of people at the second concert, use the second equation:

S = <<S = F + 119>> F + 119

S = <<S = 32,890 + 119>> 32,890 + 119

S = <<S = 33,009>> 33,009

So, there were 33,009 people at the second concert.

mrs. hilt is baking bread . she needs 5 cups of flour to bake 2 loaves of bread . how much flour will she need to make 1 loaf of bread ?,"To find out how much flour Mrs. Hilt needs to make 1 loaf of bread, we can set up a proportion:

5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = <<5 / t cups of flour}2 t{ loaves of bread} = x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}>> x / t cups of flour}1 t{ loaf of bread}

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for <<x>>:

5  1 = <<5  1 = 2x>> 2x

5 = <<5 = 2x>> 2x

To solve for <<x>>, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = <<x = 5 / 2>> 5 / 2

Now, let's simplify this fraction:

x = <<x = 2.5>> 2.5

So, Mrs. Hilt will need 2.5 cups of flour to make 1 loaf of bread.

harry hound had a terrible earache yesterday . when i peered into his ears yesterday i found 36 frisky fleas having a party in his right ear and 85 baby fleas sleeping peacefully in his left ear . i cleaned out harry hound 's ears . how many fleas perished ?,"To find out how many fleas perished, we need to add the number of fleas in Harry Hound's right ear to the number of fleas in his left ear and then subtract that total from the initial number of fleas we found in both ears. 

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Number of fleas in Harry Hound's right ear: 36
2. Number of fleas in his left ear: 85
3. Total number of fleas initially found in both ears: 36 (right ear) + 85 (left ear)

Now, we can calculate how many fleas perished:

Total fleas initially found - (Fleas in the right ear + Fleas in the left ear)

So,

36 + 85 = 121

Initial number of fleas - 121 (total in both ears) = Perished fleas

Now, let's calculate the number of perished fleas:

Initial number of fleas - 121 = Perished fleas

blithe has a lot of toys . he lost 6 of them and found 9 in his closet . if he had 43 after that how many toys did blithe have at first ?,"Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Blithe initially had a certain number of toys.
2. He lost 6 toys, which means he had 6 less toys than before.
3. Then he found 9 toys in his closet, which means he had 9 more toys than after losing some.

So, we can set up an equation to represent this:

Initial number of toys - 6 (lost) + 9 (found) = 43

Now, we can solve for the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys - 6 + 9 = 43

Subtract 6 from both sides of the equation:

Initial number of toys + 9 = 43 + 6

Initial number of toys + 9 = 49

Subtract 9 from both sides of the equation to find the initial number of toys:

Initial number of toys = 49 - 9

Initial number of toys = 40

So, Blithe initially had 40 toys.

there are some passengers on a bus . at a bus stop 7 more passengers got on the bus and 9 passengers got off . if there are 26 passengers in the bus in the end how many passengers were there at first ?,"Let's start by considering the initial number of passengers on the bus as ""x"". 

After 7 more passengers got on the bus, the total number of passengers increased by 7 to become ""x + 7"".

Then, 9 passengers got off the bus, which means the total number of passengers decreased by 9 to become ""(x + 7) - 9"".

Finally, we know that in the end there are 26 passengers on the bus, so we can set up the equation:

""(x + 7) - 9 = 26""

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

(x + 7) - 9 = 26
x + 7 - 9 = 26
x - 2 = 26
x = 26 + 2
x = 28

Therefore, there were 28 passengers on the bus initially.

bruno had some story books . he lost 4 of them and his dad gave him 10 more books . if he had 39 books after that how many books did bruno have at first ?,"Let's denote the number of books Bruno had at first as ""x"". 

According to the problem, Bruno lost 4 books, so the number of books he had after losing 4 is ""x - 4"". 

After losing 4 books, Bruno's dad gave him 10 more books, so the total number of books he had after his dad gave him the books is ""x - 4 + 10"".

We are given that Bruno had 39 books after his dad gave him the books, so we can set up the equation:

x - 4 + 10 = 39

Simplifying the equation:

x + 6 = 39

Subtracting 6 from both sides:

x = 33

Therefore, Bruno had 33 books at first.

Out of these, 26 lights are red and 37 lights are yellow. To find the number of blue lights, we need to subtract the sum of red and yellow lights from the total number of lights on the tree.

Total number of lights on the tree: 95
Number of red lights: 26
Number of yellow lights: 37

Number of blue lights = Total number of lights - Number of red lights - Number of yellow lights

Number of blue lights = 95 - 26 - 37

Total passengers = Men + Women + Children

Given:
Total passengers = 54
Men = 18
Women = 26

To find the number of children, we can subtract the number of men and women from the total passengers:

Children = Total passengers - Men - Women
Children = 54 - 18 - 26

Calculating this expression:

Children = 54 - 18 - 26
Children = 54 - (18 + 26)
Children = 54 - 44

Calculating the subtraction:

Children = 54 - 44
Children = 10

Therefore, there are 10 children on the bus.

a summer sports camp had 88 soccer campers basketball campers and football campers . if 24 of them were basketball campers and 32 of them were football campers how many soccer campers were there ?,"Let's assume the number of soccer campers is represented by the variable ""x"".

We know that the total number of campers is equal to the sum of soccer campers, basketball campers, and football campers. In this case, the total number of campers is 88.

So we can write the equation:
x + 24 + 32 = 88

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 24 and 32 from both sides:

x + 24 + 32 - 24 - 32 = 88 - 24 - 32

Simplifying the equation:
x + 56 = 56

Now, to isolate x, we need to subtract 56 from both sides:

x + 56 - 56 = 56 - 56

Simplifying the equation further:
x = 0

So, there were 0 soccer campers.

a pet store had 13 siamese cats and 5 house cats . during a sale they sold 10 cats . how many cats do they have left ?,"To find out how many cats the pet store has left, we need to subtract the number of cats sold from the total number of cats they had initially.

The pet store initially had 13 Siamese cats and 5 house cats, so the total number of cats is 13 + 5 = 18 cats.

During the sale, they sold 10 cats.

To find out how many cats they have left, we subtract 10 from the initial total of 18:

18 - 10 = 8.

Therefore, the pet store has 8 cats left.

chloe and her friends were recycling paper for their class . for every 6 pounds they recycled they earned 1 point . if chloe recycled 28 pounds and her friends recycled 2 pounds how many points did they earn ?,"To find out how many points Chloe and her friends earned, we need to calculate the number of points earned for Chloe's 28 pounds of recycled paper and her friends' 2 pounds.

For every 6 pounds recycled, they earn 1 point. We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.

<<>>
6 / t pounds}1 t{ point} = 2 / 8 t pounds}x t{ points}
<<>>

Now, we can cross-multiply and solve for x:

<<>>
6  x = 28  1
<<>>

<<>>
6x = 28
<<>>

To isolate x (the number of points), divide both sides of the equation by 6:

<<>>
x = 2 / 86
<<>>

Now, simplify the fraction:

<<>>
x = 42 / 6
<<>>

To express this as a whole number with a remainder, we can divide 4 by 6:

<<>>
4 / 6 = 0 with a remainder of 4
<<>>

So, the answer is that Chloe and her friends earned 4 points with 2 pounds of paper recycling.

victor and his friend were buying trick decks from the magic shop for 8 dollars each . how much did they spend if victor bought 6 decks and his friend bought 2 decks ?,"To find out how much Victor and his friend spent, we need to calculate the total cost of the decks they bought separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate how much Victor spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck costs 8 dollars and Victor bought 6 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks:  8 * 6 = << 8 * 6 = 48 >> 48 .

Next, let's calculate how much Victor's friend spent on the decks he bought. We know that each deck also costs 8 dollars and his friend bought 2 decks. We can calculate this by multiplying the cost per deck by the number of decks:  8 * 2 = << 8 * 2 = 16 >> 16 .

Now, let's add the amounts spent by Victor and his friend to find the total amount spent:  48 + 16 = << 48 + 16 = 64 >> 64 .

Therefore, they spent a total of 64 dollars on the trick decks.

faye 's team won their baseball game and scored 68 points total . if faye scored 28 of the points and everyone else scored 8 points each how many players were on her team ?,"Let's denote the number of players on Faye's team as <<P>>. Faye scored 28 points, and everyone else scored 8 points each. So, the total number of points scored can be represented as:

<<28 + 8P>>

We know that the total points scored by the team are 68. So, we can set up the equation:

28 + 8P = <<28 + 8P = 68>> 68

Now, let's solve for <<P>>:

Subtract 28 from both sides to isolate the term with <<P>>:

8P = <<8P = 68 - 28>> 68 - 28

8P = <<8P = 40>> 40

To find the number of players on Faye's team (<<P>>), we need to divide both sides by 8:

P = <<P = 4 / 08>> 4 / 08

Now, calculate the value of <<P>>:

P = <<P = 5>> 5

So, there were 5 players on Faye's team.

there are 407 bananas in philip 's banana collection . if the bananas are organized into 11 groups how big is each group ?,"To find the size of each group, we need to divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups.

Total number of bananas = 407
Number of groups = 11

To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of groups:

 407 / 11 = << 407 / 11 = #### >> #### 

Hence, each group will have #### bananas.
