$14 - 5 = 9$

Now, we need to calculate the total time required to install these remaining 9 windows. Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of remaining windows by 4 to get the total time:

$9 \times 4 = 36$

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.

The total time to paint all the rooms can be calculated by multiplying the number of rooms by the time it takes to paint each room. In this case, there are 12 rooms and each room takes 3 hours to paint, so the total time is $12 \times 3 = 36$ hours.

The time already spent painting 4 rooms can be calculated by multiplying the number of rooms already painted by the time it takes to paint each room. In this case, 4 rooms have already been painted and each room takes 3 hours to paint, so the time already spent is $4 \times 3 = 12$ hours.

To find out how much longer the painter will take to paint the rest of the rooms, we subtract the time already spent from the total time. So, the remaining time can be calculated as $36 - 12 = 24$ hours.

Therefore, the painter will take 24 hours longer to paint the rest of the rooms.

According to the information given, the library purchased 2647 books using the grant. Therefore, we can represent this as an equation: $x + 2647 = 8582$.

To find the value of $x$, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 2647 from both sides of the equation:

$x + 2647 - 2647 = 8582 - 2647$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$x = 5935$

Therefore, the library had 5935 books before receiving the grant.

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 11 - 2

Let's assume the number of large rooms to be rented as ""x"". Since each large room can accommodate 3 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""x"" large rooms would be 3x.

Similarly, let's assume the number of small rooms to be rented as ""y"". Since each small room can accommodate 2 people, the total number of people that can be accommodated in ""y"" small rooms would be 2y.

According to the given information, there are a total of 26 people in the tourist group. Therefore, we can write an equation based on the total number of people:

3x + 2y = 26

To minimize the number of rooms required, we need to find the smallest possible values for ""x"" and ""y"" that satisfy this equation.

Now, let's solve this equation step by step:

1. Start with assuming a value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 0 (i.e., no large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 0 into the equation: 
   3(0) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying: 
   2y = 26
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 13

   So, if no large rooms are rented (x = 0), we would need to rent 13 small rooms.

2. Now, let's assume a value for ""x"" again. Let's assume x = 1 (i.e., one large room is rented).

   Substituting x = 1 into the equation:
   3(1) + 2y = 26
   Simplifying:
   3 + 2y = 26
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   2y = 23
   Divide both sides by 2:
   y = 11.5

   Since the number of rooms must be a whole number, we cannot have a fraction of a room. Therefore, assuming x = 1 does not give us a valid solution.

3. Let's assume another value for ""x"". Let's assume x = 2 (i.e., two large rooms are rented).

   Substituting x = 2 into the"

To find the amount of money Will had left, we subtract the amount spent on new mower blades from the total amount made:

$104 - $41 = $63

Now, we divide the remaining amount of money by the cost of each game to find out how many games Will can buy:

$63 ÷ $9 = 7

Therefore, Will can buy 7 nine-dollar games with the money he had left.

Step 1: Determine the number of whole boxes Nathan ate.
- Each package contains 5 gumballs, so we need to find how many packages Nathan ate.
- To do this, we divide the total number of gumballs Nathan ate by the number of gumballs in each package: $20 \div 5 = 4$.
- So, Nathan ate 4 whole boxes of gumballs.

Step 2: Determine the number of gumballs Nathan has left.
- We know that each box contains 5 gumballs, and Nathan ate 4 boxes.
- To find the total number of gumballs he ate, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of gumballs in each box: $4 \times 5 = 20$.
- Therefore, Nathan ate a total of 20 gumballs.

Step 3: Find the number of gumballs Nathan has left.
- To do this, we subtract the total number of gumballs Nathan ate from the initial number of gumballs: $20 - 20 = 0$.
- So, Nathan has no gumballs left.

Speed = Distance / Time

In this case, the distance is 500 meters and the time taken is 6 minutes. However, we need to convert the time into hours since speed is typically measured in units of distance per unit of time. 

To convert minutes to hours, we divide the number of minutes by 60:

Time (in hours) = 6 minutes / 60 = 0.1 hours

Now we can calculate the speed:

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed = 500 meters / 0.1 hours

To simplify the calculation, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 0.1:

Speed = (500 meters / 0.1 hours) / 0.1
Speed = 5000 meters / 1 hour

So you were traveling at a speed of 5000 meters per hour.

Let's assume the number of toys in stock at the beginning is represented by the variable $x$. 

According to the information given, the store sold 38 toys in the first week and 26 toys in the second week. So the total number of toys sold is $38 + 26$.

To find the number of toys left in stock, we subtract the total number of toys sold from the initial number of toys in stock: $x - (38 + 26)$.

The problem states that there were 19 toys left. Therefore, we can set up the equation: $x - (38 + 26) = 19$.

Now, let's solve for $x$.

First, let's simplify the equation by calculating $38 + 26$: $x - 64 = 19$.

Next, we isolate the variable $x$ by adding 64 to both sides of the equation: $x = 19 + 64$.

Finally, we calculate the sum on the right side of the equation: $x = 83$.

So, the initial number of toys in stock was 83.

991,a store has number0 shirts . after selling some there were number1 left . how many did they sell ?,"[49,28]","[-,number0,number1]",21,"[2,3,4,10,11,12,16,17,18]",a store has number0 shirts . after selling some there were number1 left .,how many did they sell ?,,[],2902,"Let's denote the number of shirts sold as ""x"". 

Initially, the store had 49 shirts. After selling ""x"" shirts, there were 28 left. 

We can represent this situation with the equation: 

$49 - x = 28$

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. 

Subtracting 28 from both sides of the equation, we have: 

$49 - x - 28 = 28 - 28$

Simplifying, we get: 

$21 - x = 0$

To isolate ""x"", we subtract 21 from both sides of the equation: 

$21 - x - 21 = 0 - 21$

Simplifying further, we have: 

$-x = -21$

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides of the equation by -1 to eliminate the negative sign: 

$-1 \cdot (-x) = -1 \cdot (-21)$

This gives us: 

$x = 21$

Therefore, the store sold 21 shirts.

Initially, the farmer had 46 tomatoes. After picking some, he had 3 left. This can be represented as an equation:

46 - x = 3

To find the value of ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

46 - x - 3 = 3 - 3
43 - x = 0

Now, to isolate ""x"", we can subtract 43 from both sides:

43 - x - 43 = 0 - 43
-x = -43

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides by -1 to change the sign:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-43)
x = 43

Therefore, the farmer picked 43 tomatoes.

According to the information given, Billy initially had 48 tickets and after buying the yoyo, he had 32 tickets left. This can be expressed as an equation:

$ 48 - x = 32 $

To find the value of $ x $, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's subtract 32 from both sides:

$ 48 - 32 - x = 32 - 32 $

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$ 16 - x = 0 $

Now, let's isolate $ x $ by subtracting 16 from both sides:

$ 16 - x - 16 = 0 - 16 $

Simplifying further:

$ -x = -16 $

To solve for $ x $, we can multiply both sides by -1 to get rid of the negative sign:

$ (-1)(-x) = (-1)(-16) $

This simplifies to:

$ x = 16 $

Therefore, the yoyo cost Billy 16 tickets.

During the lunch rush, he added another 12 customers. To find out how many customers left a tip, we need to subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.

Total number of customers = initial customers + added customers
Total number of customers = 39 + 12

To find out how many customers left a tip, we subtract the number of customers who didn't leave a tip from the total number of customers.

Number of customers who left a tip = Total number of customers - Number of customers who didn't leave a tip
Number of customers who left a tip = (39 + 12) - 49

Now we can calculate the answer:

Number of customers who left a tip = (39 + 12) - 49
Number of customers who left a tip = 51 - 49
Number of customers who left a tip = 2

Therefore, 2 customers left a tip.

2. Monthly expenses:
The condition states that in order to avail the special price, you need to spend $7 per month for 4 months. So, we need to calculate the total amount spent on monthly expenses.

Total monthly expenses = Monthly expense * Number of months
Total monthly expenses = $7 * 4
Total monthly expenses = $28

Now, we can calculate the total cost by adding the cost of the phone and the total monthly expenses.

Total cost = Cost of the phone + Total monthly expenses
Total cost = $2 + $28

The total number of fleas in Harry Hound's ears is the sum of the fleas in his right ear and the fleas in his left ear. 

Fleas in the right ear = 36

To find the total number of fleas, we add these two numbers together:

Total fleas = 36 + 85

Calculating this sum gives us:

Total fleas = 121

After cleaning out Harry Hound's ears, there were no more fleas left. Therefore, all 121 fleas perished.

So, the number of fleas that perished is:

According to the problem, 7 more passengers got on the bus, so we can add 7 to $x$ to represent the new total number of passengers on the bus. This can be written as $x + 7$.

Additionally, 9 passengers got off the bus. To represent this, we subtract 9 from the previous total. This can be written as $(x + 7) - 9$.

Finally, we are given that there are 26 passengers on the bus in the end. So we can set up an equation: $(x + 7) - 9 = 26$.

To solve for $x$, we simplify the equation:
$x + 7 - 9 = 26$
$x - 2 = 26$

To isolate $x$, we add 2 to both sides of the equation:
$x - 2 + 2 = 26 + 2$
$x = 28$

Therefore, there were initially 28 passengers on the bus.

Total money made mowing lawns = $69
Money spent on new mower blades = $24

To find the money Mike had left, we subtract the amount spent on new mower blades from the total money made:

Money left = Total money made - Money spent on new mower blades
Money left = $69 - $24

Now, let's calculate the value of ""Money left"":

Money left = 69 - 24
Money left = 45

So, Mike had $45 left after buying new mower blades.

To determine how many 5-dollar games he can buy with this amount, we divide the money left by the cost of each game:

Number of 5-dollar games = Money left / Cost per game
Number of 5-dollar games = $45 / $5

Now, let's calculate the value of ""Number of 5-dollar games"":

Number of 5-dollar games = 45 / 5
Number of 5-dollar games = 9

Therefore, Mike can buy 9 five-dollar games with the money he had left.

According to the information given, the tallest player is 75 inches taller than the shortest player. Therefore, we can express the height of the tallest player as $ x + 75 $. 

Given that the tallest player is 77 inches tall, we can set up an equation:

$ x + 75 = 77 $

To solve for $ x $, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 75 from both sides:

$ x + 75 - 75 = 77 - 75 $

Simplifying:

$ x = 2 $

Therefore, the shortest player is 2 inches tall.

Based on the study results ,",how many woman in a group of number4 women over the age of number5 would likely be married number6 or more times ?,,[],405,"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of proportions. 

First, let's find the proportion of women who were married 2 or more times in the random sampling of 100 women over the age of 35. We can do this by dividing the number of women who were married 2 or more times (8) by the total number of women in the sample (100):

$ \text{Proportion} = \frac{8}{100} $

Next, we can use this proportion to estimate the number of women who would likely be married 2 or more times in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35. We can do this by multiplying the proportion by the total number of women in the larger group:

$ \text{Estimated number} = \text{Proportion} \times \text{Total number} $

$ \text{Estimated number} = \frac{8}{100} \times 5000 $

Now, let's calculate this:

$ \text{Estimated number} = \frac{8}{100} \times 5000 = 40 $

Therefore, based on the study results, it is estimated that there would be approximately 40 women in a group of 5000 women over the age of 35 who would likely be married 2 or more times.

To add these fractions together, we can convert them to a common denominator. The common denominator for 0.125, 0.125, and 0.5 is 1.

Converting 0.125 to have a denominator of 1:
$ \frac{0.125}{1} = \frac{0.125 \times 8}{1 \times 8} = \frac{1}{8} $

Converting 0.125 to have a denominator of 1:
$ \frac{0.125}{1} = \frac{0.125 \times 8}{1 \times 8} = \frac{1}{8} $

Converting 0.5 to have a denominator of 1:
$ \frac{0.5}{1} = \frac{0.5 \times 2}{1 \times 2} = \frac{1}{2} $

Now we can add these fractions together:
$ \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{8} + \frac{4}{8} = \frac{7}{8} $

Therefore, the canned food would take up $\boxed{\text{7}}$ bins in total.

According to the information given, when Jake had 1 cat, he needed to serve 0.5 cans of cat food each day. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

$1 \cdot x = 0.5$

Simplifying this equation, we find that $x = 0.5$.

Now that Jake has adopted a second cat, he needs to serve a total of 0.9 cans each day. We can set up another equation to represent this situation:

$2 \cdot x = 0.9$

Simplifying this equation, we find that $x = 0.45$.

To find out how much extra food is needed to feed the second cat, we need to calculate the difference between the amount of food needed for two cats and the amount of food needed for one cat:

$0.45 - 0.5$

Simplifying this expression, we find that the extra food needed to feed the second cat is:

$-0.05$

However, since negative values don't make sense in this context (we can't have negative amounts of food), we can conclude that no extra food is needed to feed the second cat.

If they left exactly 7 nails in every station they visited, then the total number of nails they used can be calculated by multiplying the number of stations visited ($x$) by the number of nails left in each station (7). This can be expressed as $7x$.

Since they brought a bag of 140 nails, we can set up an equation to represent this situation:

$7x = 140$

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

$\frac{7x}{7} = \frac{140}{7}$

Simplifying, we get:

$x = 20$

Therefore, Joline and the junior ranger visited 20 stations.

To find the number of pieces in each of the small loads, we need to divide the remaining number of pieces by the number of small loads, which is 2.

So, let's calculate:
Remaining number of pieces = Total number of pieces of clothing - Number of pieces in the first load = 36 - 18 = 18

Number of pieces in each small load = Remaining number of pieces / Number of small loads = 18 / 2 = 9

Therefore, each of the small loads can hold 9 pieces of clothing.

Number of students selected for the team = Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked
Number of students selected for the team = 58 - 28

Now, we need to divide the number of selected students by the number of groups to find out how many students would be in each group.

Number of groups = 5

Number of students in each group = Number of selected students / Number of groups
Number of students in each group = (58 - 28) / 5

Total number of boxes sold = 24
Number of boxes in each case = 12

To find the number of cases, we divide the total number of boxes sold by the number of boxes in each case:
$ \text{Number of cases} = \frac{24}{12} $

Dividing 24 by 12 gives us a quotient of 2 and no remainder. This means that Sarah sold exactly enough boxes to fill 2 cases.

To find the extra boxes, we multiply the quotient (number of cases) by the number of boxes in each case and subtract it from the total number of boxes sold:
$ \text{Extra boxes} = (2 \times 12) - 24 $

Multiplying 2 by 12 gives us 24, and subtracting it from the total number of boxes sold (24) gives us zero. This means that Sarah doesn't need any extra boxes.

Therefore, Sarah needs 2 cases of 12 boxes and no extra boxes.

Initial amount of money = $57
Amount spent on a new game = $27

Money left = Initial amount of money - Amount spent
Money left = $57 - $27

To calculate this, we subtract the two amounts:

$57 - $27 = $30

Will has $30 left after buying the new game. 

Now, we need to determine how many 6 dollar toys Will can buy with this remaining money. We can do this by dividing the remaining money by the cost of each toy.

Cost of each toy = $6
Remaining money = $30

Number of toys Will can buy = Remaining money / Cost of each toy
Number of toys Will can buy = $30 / $6

To calculate this, we divide the two amounts:

$30 / $6 = 5

Therefore, Will can buy 5 six-dollar toys with the money he had left.

$ 12 \times 25 = 300 $ cents

Next, let's determine the value of the pennies. Each penny is worth 1 cent, so we can multiply the number of pennies (7) by the value of each penny (1 cent).

$ 7 \times 1 = 7 $ cents

Now, we need to convert the total value from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the total value in cents by 100.

Given that there are 24 crayons in total and three people, we can substitute these values into the equation:

The harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

Let's assume that the distance to CA is D miles. Therefore, the distance back from CA is also D miles.

The time taken to travel to CA at an average speed of 50 miles per hour can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed. So, the time taken to travel to CA is D / 50 hours.

Similarly, the time taken to travel back from CA at an average speed of 60 miles per hour is D / 60 hours.

The total distance traveled for the round trip is 2D miles (D miles to CA + D miles back from CA).

The total time taken for the round trip is (D / 50) + (D / 60) hours.

Now, we can calculate the average speed using the formula: average speed = total distance / total time.

Substituting in the values we have:

average speed = (2D) / ((D / 50) + (D / 60))

To simplify this expression, we need to find a common denominator for (D / 50) and (D / 60). The least common multiple of 50 and 60 is 300.

average speed = (2D) / ((6D/300) + (5D/300))

Combining like terms:

average speed = (2D) / ((11D/300))

Dividing both numerator and denominator by D:

average speed = (2/11) * (300)

Calculating this expression:

average speed = 600/11

First, let's calculate the discount amount. We know that the racket is on sale for 25% off the regular price, which means we need to find 25% of $135.

To calculate 25% of a number, we can multiply the number by 0.25.

So, 25% of $135 is calculated as follows:

$135 * 0.25 = $33.75

Now that we have found the discount amount, we can subtract it from the regular price to find the sale price.

Regular price - Discount amount = Sale price

$135 - $33.75 = $101.25

Therefore, the sale price of the tennis racket is $101.25.

Let's assume that each page has the same number of problems on it, and we'll call this unknown number of problems ""x"".

The total number of problems Sarah finished is 6, and she still has 7 pages of problems to do. Since each page has the same number of problems, the total number of problems on those 7 pages is 7 times x.

So, we can set up an equation: 

6 + 7x = 55

To solve for x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by subtracting 6 from both sides:

7x = 55 - 6

Simplifying the right side:

7x = 49

Now, to solve for x, we divide both sides by 7:

x = 49 / 7

Simplifying the right side:

x = 7

Therefore, there are 7 problems on each page.

To add these fractions, we need to find a common denominator. The smallest number that both 6 and 3 divide into evenly is 6.

Converting the fractions to have a denominator of 6:
- The fraction of one-bedroom apartments becomes 1/6 (since 1 multiplied by 6 equals 6).
- The fraction of two-bedroom apartments becomes 2/6 (since 2 multiplied by 3 equals 6).

Now we can add these fractions together:

First, we know that the total number of friends Mrs. Hilt met is 15. We can denote this as $x$.

Second, we know that 9 of these friends were carrying pears. We can denote this as $y$. So, we have $y = 9$.

The question asks how many friends were carrying oranges. To find this, we subtract the number of friends carrying pears from the total number of friends. This gives us $x - y$.

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

$x - y = 15 - 9$

Solving this equation gives us the number of friends carrying oranges:

$x - 9 = 6$

So, the friends carrying oranges is 6.

Now let's solve this equation step by step:

First, distribute the multiplication:
45 + 6x - 6 = 75

Combine like terms:
6x + 39 = 75

Subtract 39 from both sides:
6x = 36

Divide both sides by 6:
x = 6

Therefore, there were 6 players on Bianca's team.

$ \text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total number of bananas}}{\text{Number of groups}} $

Substituting the given values:

$ \text{Size of each group} = \frac{36}{6} $

Simplifying the division:

$ \text{Size of each group} = 6 $

Therefore, each group will have 6 bananas.

How many miles does he walk by the 8th week ?,"[10,2]","[+,number0,*,number1,-,8.0,1.0]",24,"[9,10,11,19,20,21,30,31,32]",A man starts walking for the first week and walks number0 miles . Every week he increases the distance by number1 miles .,How many miles does he walk by the 8th week ?,,[],1710,"To find out how many miles the man walks by the 8th week, we need to calculate the total distance he walks each week and then add them up.

In the first week, he walks 10 miles.
In the second week, he walks 10 + 2 = 12 miles.
In the third week, he walks 12 + 2 = 14 miles.
And so on...

We can see that the distance increases by 2 miles each week. So, we can use a formula to calculate the total distance walked by the 8th week.

The formula for finding the sum of an arithmetic series is:
$ S_n = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) $

Where:
$ S_n $ is the sum of the series,
$ n $ is the number of terms in the series,
$ a_1 $ is the first term in the series, and
$ a_n $ is the last term in the series.

In this case, we have:
$ n = 8 $ (since we want to find out how many miles he walks by the 8th week),
$ a_1 = 10 $ (the first term is 10 miles), and
$ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d $ (where $ d $ is the common difference between terms).

Since the common difference between terms is 2 miles, we can substitute these values into our formula:

$ S_8 = \frac{8}{2}(10 + (8-1)2) $

Simplifying further:

$ S_8 = \frac{8}{2}(10 + 7 \cdot 2) $

$ S_8 = \frac{8}{2}(10 + 14) $

$ S_8 = \frac{8}{2}(24) $

$ S_8 = 4 \cdot 24 $

$ S_8 = 96 $

#### The man walks a total of 96 miles by the 8th week."

The number of puppies that were not sold can be found by subtracting the number of puppies sold from the total number of puppies:

$45 - 39 = 6$

So, there were 6 puppies that were not sold.

Now, we divide this number by 2 to find the number of cages used:

$6 \div 2 = 3$

Therefore, they used 3 cages.

Therefore, the magician sold 2 decks. 

Since each deck was sold for $2, we can multiply the number of decks sold by the price per deck to find out how much money the magician earned. 

$ 2 \times 2 = 4 $

Therefore, the magician earned $4.

Number of groups = 4

Number of students in each group = (Total number of students - Number of students who didn't get picked) / Number of groups

Number of students in each group = (64 - 36) / 4

First, let's calculate the cost of the board game. We are given that Edward spent $2 on the game.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the action figures. We know that Edward bought 4 action figures for $7 each. To find the total cost, we can multiply the cost per figure by the number of figures: $7 * 4 = $28.

Now, we can add the cost of the game ($2) to the cost of the action figures ($28) to find the total amount Edward spent: $2 + $28 = $30.

Therefore, Edward spent $30 on the game and figures.
