"At the hardware store , 0.25 the nails are size 2d and 0.5 the nails are size 4d . What fraction of the nails are either size 2d or 4d ?","To find the fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d, we need to add the fractions representing each size and then simplify the result. Let's start by calculating the fraction of nails that are size 2d. We are given that 0.25 (or 25%) of the nails are size 2d. To represent this as a fraction, we can write it as 2/5>>. Next, let's calculate the fraction of nails that are size 4d. We are given that 0.5 (or 50%) of the nails are size 4d. As a fraction, this can be written as <<5/10>>. Now, we can add these two fractions together to find the total fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d: <<2/5 + 5/10 = <<2/5>>. Next, let's calculate the fraction of nails that are size 4d. We are given that 0.5 (or 50%) of the nails are size 4d. As a fraction, this can be written as <<5/10>>. Now, we can add these two fractions together to find the total fraction of nails that are either size 2d or 4d: <<2/5 + 5/10 = 7/10>> 7/10. To simplify this fraction, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 1: 7/10 = <<7/10 = 7/10>> 7/10. Therefore, seven-tenths (or <<7/10>>) of the nails are either size 2d or 4d.
