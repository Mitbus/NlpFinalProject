"A dust storm sweeps across the prairie . It covers 64535 acres of the prairie in dust , but leaves 522 acres untouched . How many acres does the prairie cover ?","To solve this problem, we need to find the total area of the prairie. We know that the dust storm covered 64535 acres and left 522 acres untouched. 

We can calculate the total area of the prairie by adding the area covered by the dust storm and the area left untouched. 

Here's how we can do it:

 64535 + 522 = << 64535 + 522 = 64535 + 522 >> 64535 + 522 

So, the total area of the prairie is 64535 + 522 = << 65057 >> acres.

Todd's time: 88 seconds
Brian's time: 96 seconds

To calculate the difference, we subtract Brian's time from Todd's time:

 88 - 96 = << 88 - 96 = -8 >> -8 

The negative sign indicates that Todd took 8 seconds less than Brian to run around the track.

"A teacher had 38 worksheets to grade . If she graded 4 , but then another 15 were turned in , how many worksheets would she have to grade ?","The teacher initially had 34 worksheets to grade. She graded 7 of them. 

To find out how many worksheets she would have to grade after another 36 were turned in, we need to add the number of worksheets she initially had with the number of worksheets that were turned in.

So, we can calculate it as follows:

34 + 36 = <<34 + 36 = 70>> 70

Therefore, the teacher would have to grade 70 worksheets.

amy had some candy . she gave her friend 6 pieces and had 5 left . what 's the difference between of the pieces of candy amy gave away and the left ?,"To find the difference between the number of candy pieces Amy gave away and the number of candy pieces she had left, we can subtract the number of candy pieces given away from the number of candy pieces she had initially.

Let's denote the number of candy pieces Amy initially had as ""x"". According to the problem, Amy gave away 6 pieces, leaving her with 5 pieces.

So we can set up the equation: x - 6 = 5.

To find the value of x, we can add 6 to both sides of the equation: x = 5 + 6.

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 11.

Therefore, Amy initially had 11 pieces of candy. 

To find the difference between the number of candy pieces Amy gave away and the number of candy pieces she had left, we subtract the number of candy pieces given away (6) from the number of candy pieces she had left (5).

The difference is: 5 - 6 = -1.

So, the difference between the number of candy pieces Amy gave away and the number of candy pieces she had left is -1.
