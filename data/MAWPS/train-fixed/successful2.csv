An ice skating rink charges 5 dollars for admission and 2 dollars to rent skates . Jill can purchase a new pair of skates for 5 dollars . How many times would she need to go the rink to justify buying the skates rather than renting a pair ?,"To determine how many times Jill would need to go to the rink to justify buying skates instead of renting, we need to compare the total cost of renting skates each time versus the cost of purchasing skates.

Let's assume Jill goes to the rink x times. 

The cost of renting skates each time is <<2, so the total cost of renting skates x times would be 2 * x dollars.

On the other hand, if Jill decides to purchase skates, she would only need to pay >>5 once.

To justify buying skates rather than renting, the total cost of renting skates x times should be greater than or equal to the cost of purchasing skates.

So we can set up an inequality: 2 * x >= 5

Now let's solve for x:

Divide both sides of the inequality by 2:
x >= 5/2

Since we can't have a fraction of a visit, we round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Jill would need to go to the rink at least 3 times (since 5/2 rounds up to 3) in order to justify buying skates instead of renting.

Irene just bought a new lamp for her bedside table . The old lamp was 1 foot tall and the new lamp is 2.3333333333333335 feet tall . How much taller is the new lamp than the old lamp ?,"To find out how much taller the new lamp is than the old lamp, we need to subtract the height of the old lamp from the height of the new lamp.

The height of the old lamp is 1 foot, and the height of the new lamp is 2.3333333333333335 feet.

To subtract 1 foot from 2.3333333333333335 feet, we can write it as a subtraction problem:

<<2.3333333333333335 - 1>>

Subtracting these two numbers gives us:

Tim 's cat had kittens . He gave 3 to Jessica and 6 to Sara . He now has 9 kittens . How many kittens did he have to start with ?,"Let's assume that Tim started with X number of kittens.
He gave 3 kittens to Jessica and 6 kittens to Sara, which means he gave away a total of 3 + 6 = 9 kittens.
After giving away these kittens, Tim now has 9 kittens remaining.
Therefore, the equation representing this situation is X - 9 = 0.
To solve for X, we can add 9 to both sides of the equation:
X - 9 + 9 = 0 + 9
This simplifies to X = 9.
So, Tim initially had 9 kittens.

Since each player left had 5 lives, we can multiply the number of players who left (5) by the number of lives each player had (5).

 5 * 5 = << 5 * 5 = 25 >> 25 

Therefore, the total number of lives they had is 25.

sam has 58 power ranger stickers . he bundles them up in 2 boxes . if there are 23 power ranger stickers in the first box how many more power ranger stickers are there in the second box than the first box ?,"To find out how many more power ranger stickers are there in the second box than the first box, we need to subtract the number of stickers in the first box from the total number of stickers.

The total number of stickers is given as 58, and the number of stickers in the first box is given as 23. 

To find the number of stickers in the second box, we can subtract the number of stickers in the first box from the total number of stickers:

58 - 23 = <<58 - 23 = 35>> 35

Therefore, there are 35 more power ranger stickers in the second box than in the first box.

a ballet class wants to divide its 90 members into some large groups at 7 members each and some small groups at 3 members each . in order to make the least number of groups how many large groups should be made ?,"To find the least number of groups, we need to divide the total number of members by the size of each group and then round up to the nearest whole number.

Let's start by finding the number of large groups. We can divide the total number of members (90) by the size of each large group (7):

 9 / 0{7} = << 9 / 0{7} = 12.8571428571 >> 12.8571428571 

Since we cannot have a fraction of a group, we need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we should have 13 large groups.

Next, let's find the number of small groups. We can divide the remaining members (after forming the large groups) by the size of each small group (3):

 9 / 0 - (13 * 7)}{3} = << 9 / 0 - (13 * 7)}{3} = 5 >> 5 

So, we have 5 small groups.

Therefore, in order to make the least number of groups, we should have 13 large groups.
