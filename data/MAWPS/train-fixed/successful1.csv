"Gwen was organizing her book case making sure each of the shelves had exactly 9 books on it . If she had 3 shelves of mystery books and 5 shelves of picture books , how many books did she have total ?","To calculate the total number of books Gwen has, we need to find the sum of the books on each shelf. 

Let's start with the mystery books. We know that she has 3 shelves of mystery books, and each shelf has 9 books. So the total number of mystery books can be calculated as <<3 * 9>>.

Next, let's consider the picture books. We know that she has 5 shelves of picture books, and each shelf has 9 books. So the total number of picture books can be calculated as <<5 * 9>>.

To find the total number of books, we can add the number of mystery books and the number of picture books. So the equation becomes <<(3 * 9) + (5 * 9)>>.

Now, let's simplify the equation. We can factor out 9 from both terms in the equation, which gives us <<9 * (3 + 5)>>.

The expression inside the parentheses simplifies to 8, so our equation becomes <<9 * 8>>.

Finally, let's calculate the answer. 9 * 8 = <<9 * 8 = 72>> 72.

Kelly has 121 Nintendo games . How many does Kelly need to give away so that Kelly will have 22 games left ?,"Let's assume that Kelly gives away x number of Nintendo games.

Initially, Kelly has 121 Nintendo games.
After giving away x games, Kelly will have 121 - x games left.

According to the question, Kelly wants to have 22 games left.
So, we can set up the equation:

121 - x = 22

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's solve for x:

Subtracting 121 from both sides:
121 - x - 121 = 22 - 121
-x = -99

Multiplying both sides by -1 (to get rid of the negative sign):
(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-99)
x = 99

Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 99 Nintendo games.

I have a pet golden retriever . Each year he gains 11 pounds . He is 8 years old . How many pounds does he weigh ?,"To find out how much the golden retriever weighs, we need to calculate the total weight gained over the years and add it to the initial weight.

First, we need to determine the initial weight of the golden retriever. Since the question does not provide this information, we will assume an initial weight of 0 pounds.

Next, we calculate the total weight gained over 8 years. Each year, the dog gains 11 pounds, so over 8 years, it would be:

 11 * 8 = << 11 * 8 = 88 >> 88  pounds

Finally, we add the total weight gained to the initial weight:

 0 + 88 = << 0 + 88 = 88 >> 88  pounds

Therefore, the golden retriever weighs 88 pounds.

Justin needs 61 paper plates for a birthday party . He already has 26 blue plates and 7 red plates . How many more plates should Justin buy ?,"To find out how many more plates Justin should buy, we need to subtract the number of plates he already has from the total number of plates he needs.

Total number of plates needed = 61
Number of blue plates Justin already has = 26
Number of red plates Justin already has = 7

To find the number of additional plates Justin should buy, we can subtract the sum of blue and red plates he already has from the total number of plates needed:

Additional plates needed = Total number of plates needed - (Number of blue plates + Number of red plates)
Additional plates needed = 61 - (26 + 7)

Now let's calculate:

Additional plates needed = 61 - 33
Additional plates needed = 28

Therefore, Justin should buy 28 more plates.

"Wendy bought 4 new chairs and 4 new tables for her house . If she spent 6 minutes on each piece furniture putting it together , how many minutes did it take her to finish ?","To find out how many minutes it took Wendy to finish putting together all the furniture, we need to calculate the total time spent on chairs and tables separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the time spent on chairs. Wendy bought 4 new chairs, and she spent 6 minutes on each chair. We can find the total time spent on chairs by multiplying the number of chairs (4) by the time spent on each chair (6 minutes):

 4 * 6 = << 4 * 6 = 24 >> 24  minutes

Next, let's calculate the time spent on tables. Wendy also bought 4 new tables, and she spent 6 minutes on each table. We can find the total time spent on tables by multiplying the number of tables (4) by the time spent on each table (6 minutes):

 4 * 6 = << 4 * 6 = 24 >> 24  minutes

Now, we can find the total time it took Wendy to finish by adding the time spent on chairs and tables:

 24 + 24 = << 24 + 24 = 48 >> 48  minutes

Therefore, it took Wendy a total of 48 minutes to finish putting together all the furniture.

"The number of gears a machine can make varies directly by how long it operates . If it can make 2088 gears in 8 hours , How many gears can it make in 9 hours ?","To solve this problem, we can set up a proportion using the concept of direct variation.

Let's assume that the number of gears the machine can make is directly proportional to the number of hours it operates. We can represent this relationship as:

Number of gears / Number of hours = Constant

Let's call this constant ""k"". So, we have:

Number of gears / Number of hours = k

Now, we are given that the machine can make 2088 gears in 8 hours. We can substitute these values into our equation:

2088 / 8 = k

To find the value of ""k"", we divide 2088 by 8:

k = 261

Now that we have the value of ""k"", we can use it to find how many gears the machine can make in 9 hours. Let's call this unknown value ""x"". We can set up another proportion using our constant ""k"":

Number of gears / Number of hours = k

x / 9 = 261

To solve for ""x"", we multiply both sides of the equation by 9:

9 * (x / 9) = 261 * 9

This simplifies to:

x = 2349

Therefore, the machine can make 2349 gears in 9 hours.

x = <<x = 42 - 29>> 42 - 29

Simplifying the right side of the equation: 

x = <<x = 13>> 13

Therefore, 13 more birds flew up to the tree.

"A ship full of grain crashes into a coral reef . By the time the ship is fixed , 49952 tons of grain have spilled into the water . Only 918 tons of grain remain onboard . How many tons of grain did the ship originally contain ?","Let's denote the original amount of grain in the ship as ""x"" tons. We know that 49952 tons of grain have spilled into the water and only 918 tons remain onboard. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation: x - 49952 = 918.

To find the value of x, we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Adding 49952 to both sides gives us:

x - 49952 + 49952 = 918 + 49952.

Simplifying this equation:

x = 50870.

Hence, the ship originally contained 50870 tons of grain.

"Luke was putting his spare change into piles . He had 5 piles of quarters and 5 piles of dimes . If each pile had 3 coins in it , how many coins did he have total ?","To find the total number of coins Luke had, we need to calculate the number of quarters and dimes separately and then add them together.

Given:
Number of piles of quarters = 5
Number of piles of dimes = 5
Number of coins in each pile = 3

To find the total number of quarters, we can multiply the number of piles of quarters by the number of coins in each pile:
Total number of quarters = 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 quarters

Similarly, to find the total number of dimes, we can multiply the number of piles of dimes by the number of coins in each pile:
Total number of dimes = 5 piles * 3 coins/pile = 15 dimes

Now, to find the total number of coins, we add the number of quarters and dimes together:
Total number of coins = Total number of quarters + Total number of dimes = 15 quarters + 15 dimes = 30 coins

Therefore, Luke had a total of 30 coins.

"Luke had 47 pieces of clothing to wash . He put 17 of them in one load , but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads . How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads ?","Luke had 47 pieces of clothing in total.
He put 17 of them in one load.
To find out how many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads, we need to subtract the number of pieces in the first load from the total number of pieces and then divide it by the number of small loads.

Total number of pieces - Number of pieces in first load = Number of pieces for small loads
47 - 17 = 30

Number of pieces for small loads / Number of small loads = Number of pieces per small load
30 / 5 = 6

Therefore, each small load can hold 6 pieces of clothing.

Kelly has 121 Nintendo games . How many does she need to give away so that she will have 22 games left ?,"Let's denote the number of Nintendo games Kelly needs to give away as ""x"". 

If Kelly has 121 Nintendo games and gives away ""x"" games, she will have 121 - x games left. 

According to the problem, Kelly wants to have 22 games left after giving away some. So we can set up the equation:

121 - x = 22

To solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 121 from both sides:

121 - x - 121 = 22 - 121

Simplifying the equation gives us:

-x = -99

To solve for ""x"", we need to multiply both sides of the equation by -1:

(-1)(-x) = (-1)(-99)

This simplifies to:

x = 99

Therefore, Kelly needs to give away 99 Nintendo games in order to have 22 games left.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. Find the total number of clothes Wendy needs to wash:
   Total number of shirts = 39
   Total number of sweaters = 33
   Total number of clothes = Total number of shirts + Total number of sweaters

2. Determine the maximum number of clothes her washing machine can handle in one load:
   Maximum number of clothes per load = 8

3. Divide the total number of clothes by the maximum number of clothes per load to find the number of loads:
   Number of loads = Total number of clothes / Maximum number of clothes per load

Now let's perform the calculations:

Total number of shirts = 39
Total number of sweaters = 33
Total number of clothes = 39 + 33 = <<= 72>> 72

Maximum number of clothes per load = 8

Number of loads = 72 / 8 = <<= 9>> 9

Misha has 34 dollars . How many more dollars does she have to earn to have 47 dollars ?,"To find out how many more dollars Misha needs to earn, we can subtract the amount she already has from the desired amount.

Let's denote the amount Misha needs to earn as ""x"".

We know that Misha currently has 34 dollars, so we can set up the equation:

34 + x = <<34 + x = 47>> 47

To solve for ""x"", we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 34 from both sides:

x = <<x = 47 - 34>> 47 - 34

Simplifying the right side of the equation gives us:

x = <<x = 13>> 13

Therefore, Misha needs to earn 13 more dollars to have a total of 47 dollars.

Weight difference = Weight of yellow block - Weight of green block
Weight difference = 0.6 pounds - 0.4 pounds

Now, let's perform the subtraction:

Weight difference = 0.2 pounds

Therefore, the yellow block weighs 0.2 pounds more than the green block.

If a group of 12 people came in and 7 were kids , how much would it cost for the group to eat ?","To calculate the total cost for the group to eat at the restaurant, we need to determine the number of adult meals and multiply it by the cost per adult meal.

Given that each adult meal costs <<2 and there were 9 people in the group with 2 being kids, we can find the number of adults by subtracting the number of kids from the total number of people:

Number of adults = Total number of people - Number of kids
Number of adults = 9 - 2
Number of adults = 7

Now that we know there are 7 adults in the group, we can calculate the total cost for their meals:

Total cost for adult meals = Number of adults * Cost per adult meal
Total cost for adult meals = 7 * >>2
Total cost for adult meals = <<14

Therefore, it would cost >>14 for the group to eat at the restaurant.

If 18 of the flowers wilted before the wedding , how many bouquets could she still make ?","To find out how many bouquets Paige could still make, we need to subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers she picked. 

The total number of flowers Paige picked is 53, and the number of wilted flowers is 18. 

So, to find the number of bouquets she could still make, we can subtract the number of wilted flowers from the total number of flowers and then divide by the number of flowers in each bouquet.

Total number of flowers - Number of wilted flowers = Number of usable flowers
53 - 18 = 35

Now, we can divide the number of usable flowers by the number of flowers in each bouquet to find out how many bouquets Paige could still make.

Number of usable flowers / Number of flowers in each bouquet = Number of bouquets
35 / 7 = 5

Therefore, Paige could still make 5 bouquets for her friend's wedding.

Simplifying further:

7 = x

Therefore, Shiela used 7 different colors.

How many songs did Nancy buy total ?","Nancy bought 3 country albums and 5 pop albums. Each album came with a lyric sheet and had 8 songs. To find out how many songs Nancy bought in total, we need to calculate the total number of songs in the country albums and the total number of songs in the pop albums separately, and then add them together.

The number of songs in the country albums can be calculated by multiplying the number of country albums (3) by the number of songs per album (8). So, the total number of songs in the country albums is 3 * 8 = <<3 * 8 = 24>> 24.

Similarly, the number of songs in the pop albums can be calculated by multiplying the number of pop albums (5) by the number of songs per album (8). So, the total number of songs in the pop albums is 5 * 8 = <<5 * 8 = 40>> 40.

To find out how many songs Nancy bought in total, we add the number of songs in the country albums to the number of songs in the pop albums: 24 + 40 = <<24 + 40 = 64>> 64.

Therefore, Nancy bought a total of 64 songs.

To find the value of x, we need to solve this equation. 

Subtracting 91 from both sides of the equation, we get: 

98 - x - 91 = <<98 - x - 91 = 91 - 91>> 91 - 91

Simplifying the left side gives us: 

7 - x = <<7 - x = 0>> 0

To isolate x, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation: 

7 - x - 7 = <<7 - x - 7 = 0 - 7>> 0 - 7

Simplifying further gives us: 

-x = <<-x = -7>> -7

To solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by -1: 

-1 * (-x) = <<-1 * (-x) = -1 * (-7)>> -1 * (-7)

This simplifies to: 

x = <<x = 7>> 7

Therefore, Gwen gave away 7 DS games to her friends.

In this case, the total number of windows needed is 14 and the number of windows already installed is 5. So, the number of windows left to be installed is:

14 - 5 = <<14 - 5 = 9>> 9

Now, we can calculate the total time required to install the remaining windows. Since it takes 4 hours to install each window, we can multiply the number of windows left to be installed by 4:

9 * 4 = <<9 * 4 = 36>> 36

Therefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.

in a video game each enemy defeated gives you 3 points . if a level has 6 enemies total and you destroy all but 2 of them how many points would you earn ?,"To find the number of points earned, we need to calculate the number of enemies defeated and then multiply it by 3.

Given that there are a total of 6 enemies in the level and you destroy all but 2 of them, we can find the number of enemies defeated by subtracting the remaining enemies from the total number of enemies.

Total enemies - Remaining enemies = Enemies defeated
6 - 2 = 4

Now, we can calculate the number of points earned by multiplying the number of enemies defeated by 3.

Enemies defeated * 3 = Points earned
4 * 3 = 12

Therefore, you would earn 12 points.

kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother . if each box has 6 pieces inside it how many pieces did kaleb still have ?,"To find out how many pieces of chocolate candy Kaleb still has, we need to subtract the number of boxes he gave to his little brother from the total number of boxes he bought. 

Kaleb bought 14 boxes of chocolate candy and gave 5 to his little brother. So, the number of boxes Kaleb still has is given by:

14 - 5 = <<14 - 5 = 9>> 9

Now, since each box has 6 pieces inside it, we can find the total number of pieces Kaleb still has by multiplying the number of boxes he has by the number of pieces in each box:

9 * 6 = <<9 * 6 = 54>> 54

Therefore, Kaleb still has 54 pieces of chocolate candy.

adam earned 9 dollars for each lawn he mowed . if he had 12 lawns to mow but forgot to mow 8 of them how much money did he actually earn ?,"To find out how much money Adam actually earned, we need to calculate the total amount he would have earned if he had mowed all 12 lawns and then subtract the amount he did not earn for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow.

The amount Adam earned for each lawn is given as <<9. 

To calculate the total amount he would have earned if he had mowed all 12 lawns, we can multiply the number of lawns by the amount earned per lawn:

>>9 * 12 = <<108

So, Adam would have earned >>108 if he had mowed all 12 lawns.

Now, we need to subtract the amount he did not earn for the 8 lawns he forgot to mow. Since each lawn is worth <<9, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of forgotten lawns by the amount earned per lawn:

>>9 * 8 = <<72

Therefore, Adam actually earned:

>>108 - 72 = <<72 = >> 36

sam invited 9 friends to a birthday party but 6 could n't come . if he wanted to buy enough cupcakes so each person could have exactly 2 how many should he buy ?,"To find out how many cupcakes Sam should buy, we need to calculate the number of people who will be attending the party.

First, we start with the total number of friends Sam invited, which is 9. Then, we subtract the number of friends who couldn't come, which is 6.

 9 - 6 = << 9 - 6 = 3 >> 3 

So, there will be 3 friends attending the party. 

Since Sam wants each person to have exactly 2 cupcakes, we multiply the number of attendees by 2.

 3 * 2 = << 3 * 2 = 6 >> 6 

Therefore, Sam should buy 6 cupcakes for the party.

the school is planning a field trip . there are 60 students and 10 seats on each school bus . how many buses are needed to take the trip ?,"To find out how many buses are needed for the field trip, we need to divide the total number of students by the number of seats on each bus.

Total number of students = 60
Number of seats on each bus = 10

To calculate the number of buses needed, we can use the formula:

Number of buses = Total number of students / Number of seats on each bus

Substituting the given values into the formula:

Number of buses = 60 / 10

Performing the division:

Number of buses = 6

Therefore, 6 buses are needed to take the field trip.
