question,answer
9 boys went to water trees . there were 29 trees . if each of them watered the equal amount of trees how many trees did each boy water ?,"To find out how many trees each boy watered, we can divide the total number of trees by the number of boys. 

Total number of trees: 29
Number of boys: 9

To find out how many trees each boy watered, we divide the total number of trees by the number of boys:

29 / 9 = <<29 / 9 = 3.22222222222>> 3.22222222222

Since we cannot have a fraction of a tree, we round the answer to the nearest whole number:

<<3.22222222222 â‰ˆ 3>>

Therefore, each boy watered approximately 3 trees.
